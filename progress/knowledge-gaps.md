## Current Knowledge Gaps

### Business Taxation (Section 179, MACRS, Depreciation)
- **Date Identified**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: High (Business taxation is significant CFP exam area)
- **Status**: Needs More Work
- **Notes**: Topics introduced when tired - needs dedicated review session. Concepts include: Section 179 expensing, MACRS depreciation, mid-quarter convention, start-up cost rules, Section 1245 recapture. Student felt overwhelmed by multiple complex concepts at once.

### Medicare Cost Calculations
- **Date Identified**: 2025-10-15
- **Severity**: Medium → Low
- **Status**: In Progress (Improving!)
- **Notes**: Initially struggled with calculating totals. After practice (2025-10-16), successfully calculated 25 days × $408 = $10,200 correctly. Still needs to memorize benefit period day ranges (1-60, 61-90, 91-150) but calculation skills are solid.

### Social Security Early Filing Reduction Percentage
- **Date Identified**: 2025-10-16
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: Needs Minor Refinement
- **Notes**: Understands early filing reduces benefits but thinks reduction is ~5% per year. Actual reduction is ~6-7% per year (approximately 20% for 3 years early, not 15%). Concept is solid, just needs exact percentage.

## Recently Resolved (Session 2025-10-11)

### IRA Contribution vs Deduction Rules
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: High → Resolved
- **Notes**: Initially confused about active participant impact on deductibility. Now understands contribution (needs earned income) vs deduction (affected by active participant status + AGI limits).

### R-squared and Systematic/Unsystematic Risk
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: Medium → Resolved
- **Notes**: Didn't know formula initially. Learned: Unsystematic risk = 1 - R², where R² = correlation². Mastered quickly with practice.

### Short Selling vs Options
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: Medium → Resolved
- **Notes**: Confused short selling with options terminology. Now understands: short selling = unlimited risk, no expiration; puts = limited risk, has expiration. Use short selling for indefinite timeline, puts for timing confidence.

### Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rates
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: High → Resolved
- **Notes**: Applied ordinary rate (24%) to LTCG instead of preferential rate (15%). Now knows: 0%/15%/20% based on ordinary bracket, not ordinary rates.

### Tax Doctrines (Step Transaction, etc.)
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: High → Resolved
- **Notes**: No prior knowledge. Learned all four: Step transaction (collapse multiple steps), Constructive receipt (income when available), Assignment of income (taxed to earner), Tax-deferred exchange (1031).

### Passive Activity Loss Rules
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: Medium → Resolved
- **Notes**: Understood once explained. Key learning: $25k exception phases out at $100k-$150k AGI; ALL suspended losses released when property sold in taxable transaction.

### QCD Tax Treatment
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: Low → Resolved
- **Notes**: Initially thought "no benefit" - now understands exclusion from income (keeps AGI low) is better than withdrawal + deduction.

### Life Insurance Payable to Estate
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: Medium → Resolved
- **Notes**: Didn't understand why anyone would do this. Now understands: to person = avoids probate; to estate = goes through probate (used for estate liquidity or by mistake).

### Nondiscrimination Testing Formulas
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: High → Resolved
- **Notes**: Didn't remember formulas. Once shown structure, calculated perfectly: Ratio test = (non-HCE %) ÷ (HCE %) ≥ 70%.

### Put Option Risk Profile
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-10-11
- **Severity**: Low → Resolved
- **Notes**: Initially thought max loss = price change + premium. Corrected: Max loss = premium only.
