## B. General Principles of Financial Planning (15%)

**Slides**: Fundamentals (pages 40-90)

### ✅ Mastered Topics (8/10)

- [x] **B.7 Financial planning process** (2025-10-20) - **Medium-High confidence**
  - **Integrated planning**: Address stated client objectives, identify gaps
  - **Estate preservation** vs estate building vs income generation
  - Real-world intuition vs CFP exam logic
  - **Gina LTC problem**: Learned to match recommendation to stated objectives
  - **In slides**: Pages 40-45 (7-step process)

- [x] **B.8 Financial statements** (2025-11-01) - **High confidence** (PARTIAL)
  - **Fixed vs Variable Cash Outflows** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **Fixed Expenses**: Same exact dollar amount every single month
      - Can predict EXACT number, doesn't change based on usage
      - Examples: Mortgage, car loan, insurance premiums, HOA fees, subscriptions, property taxes
      - Test: Can you predict the exact $? If YES → Fixed
    - **Variable Expenses**: Amount changes month to month
      - Know you'll have expense, but dollar varies based on usage/season/behavior
      - Examples: Utilities, food/groceries, gas, travel, clothing, medical, home maintenance
      - Test: Can you predict the exact $? If NO (could be $100 or $300) → Variable
    - **Key Distinction**: Regular expense ≠ Fixed expense
      - Utilities are REGULAR (pay monthly) but VARIABLE (amount changes)
      - Mortgage is REGULAR and FIXED (same $2,500 every month)
    - **Budgeting Application**:
      - Step 1: Calculate fixed expenses (non-negotiable floor)
      - Step 2: Estimate variable expenses (average with buffer)
      - Step 3: Build flexibility for variable fluctuations
    - **Memory Trick**: "If the NUMBER changes, it's VARIABLE. If the NUMBER is the SAME, it's FIXED"
    - Perfect understanding after one explanation ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 45-50 (Balance sheet, Income statement, Cash flow statement)
  - **Still need to cover**: Net worth calculation, asset/liability classification, balance sheet structure

- [x] **B.9 Cash flow management** (2025-10-20, 2025-10-29, 2025-11-01) - **High confidence**
  - **Emergency fund guidelines**: 3-6 months of expenses
  - **6-month rule**: Married with one income source (vs 3 months dual income)
  - **Liquidity assessment**: What counts as accessible funds
  - **Key rule**: Assets maturing within 3-6 months count as emergency fund
  - **Jack problem**: Bond maturing in 3 months = liquid ($44,200 total) ✓
  - **What counts**:
    - Cash, savings, money market
    - Short-term CDs
    - Bonds maturing within 3-6 months (no market risk)
  - **What doesn't count**:
    - Retirement accounts (penalties + taxes)
    - Long-term bonds not near maturity (market value risk)
  - **Home Equity Access Methods** (2025-10-29) - MASTERED (with critical analysis):
    - **Four methods to utilize home equity**:
      1. **Reverse mortgage** (age 62+): Keep house, receive payments, repaid at death/move
      2. **Home sale**: Sell house, convert equity to cash (lose house)
      3. **Second mortgage**: Keep house, borrow 70-80% equity as lump sum
      4. **HELOC**: Keep house, draw as needed like credit card
    - **CRITICAL INSIGHT** - Student identified question flaw:
      - Normal usage: "Access equity" = keep house (methods 1, 3, 4)
      - Question says "utilize equity" = includes selling (all 4 methods)
      - Student correctly argued selling shouldn't be called "accessing"
      - **Excellent professional judgment**: CFP should test real-world communication
      - For exam: "Utilize/monetize/convert" = broader than "access"
    - Home Equity = Home Value - Mortgage Balance
    - Selling converts illiquid equity → liquid cash
  - **In slides**: Pages 45-50

- [x] **B.12 Time value of money** (2025-10-17) - **High confidence**
  - PV/FV calculations: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n
  - Compound interest
  - **In slides**: Pages 50-55, formulas and examples
  - **Note**: Had prior knowledge, perfect execution

- [x] **B.10 Financing and debt management** (2025-11-01) - **High confidence**
  - **Financial Ratios - The "28-36 + 3-6-10" Memory System** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **Housing Ratio (Front-end)**: Monthly Housing (PITI) ÷ Gross Monthly Income ≤ **28%**
      - PITI = Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance
      - Only housing costs, not other debt
    - **Total Debt Ratio (Back-end)**: Total Monthly Debt ÷ Gross Monthly Income ≤ **36%**
      - Includes ALL debt: Housing + car + student loans + credit cards + other
    - **Emergency Fund Ratio**: **3-6 months** of expenses saved
      - 6 months if: Married with one income OR self-employed
      - 3 months if: Dual income household
    - **Current Ratio**: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities ≥ **1.0** (higher is better)
      - Measures liquidity - can you pay short-term debts?
    - **Savings Ratio**: Annual Savings ÷ Gross Annual Income = **10-12%**
      - Includes retirement contributions, emergency fund savings
    - **Memory Trick**: "28 before 36" (Housing comes before Total, like house is foundation)
    - **Memory System**: "28-36 Rule + 3-6-10" (debt ratios, then emergency months, then savings %)
    - Perfect on practice problem (Sarah & Tom 27% housing, 35% total debt) ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 50-60 (Ratios, Mortgages, Buy vs Rent)
  - **Still need to cover**: Mortgage types (conventional, ARM, reverse), refinancing decisions, buy vs rent analysis

- [x] **B.11 Economic concepts** (2025-10-27) - **Medium confidence** (PARTIAL)
  - **Fiscal Policy** (MASTERED):
    - Fiscal = Government (Congress/President) uses taxes and spending
    - Monetary = Federal Reserve uses interest rates and money supply
    - **Restrictive/Contractionary fiscal policy**: Increase taxes + Decrease spending
      - Goal: Slow economy to fight inflation
      - Result: Budget surplus → Pays down government debt
    - **Expansionary fiscal policy**: Decrease taxes + Increase spending
      - Goal: Stimulate economy
      - Result: Budget deficit → Increases debt
    - **Key distinction**: Fiscal vs Monetary are different tools, not opposing forces
  - **GDP Components** (MASTERED):
    - **Formula**: GDP = C + I + G + NX (MUST MEMORIZE)
      - C = Consumption (household spending, ~70% of GDP)
      - I = Investment (business spending + new home purchases)
      - G = Government Spending (salaries, military, infrastructure)
      - NX = Net Exports (Exports - Imports)
    - **What GDP measures**: PRODUCTION, not debt or financial metrics
    - **What's NOT in GDP**: National debt, exchange rates, GNI
  - **Economic Indicators** (PARTIAL):
    - Federal Reserve's dual mandate: Low inflation (~2%) + High employment
    - **Indicators Fed watches**: GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation (PPI/CPI/PCE)
    - **National debt**: Affects rates indirectly (crowding out), but not primary Fed indicator
    - Student showed excellent real-world observation skills
  - **In slides**: Pages 60-90
  - **Still need to cover**: Business cycle (4 phases), monetary/fiscal policy tools, supply/demand

- [x] **B.13 Education needs analysis** (2025-10-27) - **Medium confidence** (PARTIAL)
  - **What it calculates**: How much to SAVE for future education costs
  - **Key factors needed**:
    - ✅ Expected inflation rate (project future costs)
    - ✅ Time until college begins (time horizon for savings/investments)
    - ✅ Expected investment returns
  - **What's NOT included**:
    - ❌ Student's career longevity (happens after college, irrelevant to costs)
    - ❌ Family's financial aid contribution (too uncertain, separate analysis)
  - **Critical distinction**:
    - **Education Needs Analysis** (CFP does): Calculate costs and required savings
    - **Financial Aid Analysis** (FAFSA does): Estimate aid eligibility (separate process)
  - **Planning approach**: Plan for full cost, treat financial aid as bonus (don't rely on uncertain aid)
  - **In slides**: Pages 55-60
  - **Still need to cover**: Detailed calculation methodology, SAI (Student Aid Index), dependency status

- [x] **B.14 Education savings vehicles** (2025-11-01) - **High confidence**
  - **Financial Aid Decision Tree** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **When financial aid mentioned**: Roth IRA (parent's)
      - NOT counted as asset on FAFSA (retirement accounts excluded = 0% assessment)
      - Contributions can be withdrawn anytime, tax-free, penalty-free
      - Protects aid eligibility
      - Distributions DO count as income (time strategically - after last FAFSA year)
    - **When financial aid NOT mentioned**: 529 Plan
      - Higher contribution limits ($100K+ per child)
      - State tax deduction (in most states)
      - No income limits
      - Tax-free growth for qualified education expenses
    - **FAFSA Asset Treatment**:
      - Roth IRA (parent): 0% assessment ✅ BEST for financial aid
      - 529 Plan: 5.64% parent asset (moderate impact)
      - Coverdell ESA: 5.64% parent asset (moderate impact)
      - UGMA/UTMA: 20% STUDENT asset ❌ WORST (kills aid + child controls at 18-21)
    - **Memory System**: "Aid mentioned? → Roth wins. Aid not mentioned? → 529 wins."
    - **EXCELLENT pattern recognition** - Student independently identified this pattern! ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 60-70 (529, Coverdell, UGMA/UTMA, Roth IRA, Series EE bonds, 529A ABLE)

- [x] **B.16 Gift/income tax strategies** (2025-11-01) - **High confidence**
  - **AOTC vs LLC** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **AOTC (American Opportunity Tax Credit)**:
      - Who: Undergraduate ONLY (first 4 years of college)
      - Maximum: $2,500 per student
      - Calculation: 100% of first $2K + 25% of next $2K
      - Enrollment: Must be at least half-time
      - Refundable: 40% refundable (up to $1,000 back even if no tax)
      - MAGI Phase-out (Single): $80K-$90K, (MFJ): $160K-$180K

      - Who: Anyone (grad school, professional, continuing ed, unlimited years)
      - Maximum: $2,000 per FAMILY (not per student!)
      - Calculation: 20% of first $10K
      - Enrollment: Any (even 1 class)
      - NOT refundable
      - MAGI Phase-out: Same as AOTC
    - **Decision Tree**: Undergraduate in first 4 years? → AOTC (almost always wins with $2,500 max)
    - **Key Exam Traps**:
      - "Per student vs per family" - AOTC per student, LLC per family
      - "Refundable" - AOTC 40% refundable, LLC not refundable
      - "First 4 years limit" - AOTC can only claim 4 times per student
    - **Memory System**: "Undergrad gets MORE, Grad gets LESS"
    - **EXCELLENT pattern recognition** - Student said "AOTC for undergrad, LLC for postgrad" ✓
    - Perfect on practice problem (Jennifer $8K tuition → AOTC $2,500 vs LLC $1,600) ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 70-80 (Student Loan Interest, LLC, AOTC, Employer Education Assistance)

## D. Investment Planning (17%)

**Slides**: Investments (188 pages)

### ✅ Mastered Topics (8/9 - partial)

- [x] **D.27 Investment vehicles** (2025-10-24, 2025-11-01) - **High confidence** (PARTIAL)
  - **Zero-Coupon Bonds** (2025-10-24) - MASTERED:
    - Buy at discount, receive par at maturity
    - No coupon payments (hence "zero coupon")

    - **What it is**: Pools of home mortgages packaged into securities
    - **Backed by US government** → Low default risk ✓
    - **The Problem: Prepayment Risk** ❌
      - Homeowners can prepay mortgages anytime (refinance, sell, extra payments)
      - When rates drop → lots of refinancing → lots of prepayments
      - Investor gets principal back early → must reinvest at lower rates
      - Monthly cash flow is UNPREDICTABLE (could be $500 or $800)
    - **Key Distinction**: "GNMA has a fixed RATE but not fixed CASH FLOW"
      - Fixed rate: Coupon rate doesn't change (e.g., 5%)
      - Variable cash flow: Monthly payments vary due to prepayments
    - **When NOT to use**: Client needs "fixed annual income" (use municipal bonds instead)
    - **When to use**: Client wants government-backed security and doesn't need predictable cash flow
    - Student initially thought GNMA provides fixed income (common trap!) ✓
    - Now understands difference between fixed rate vs fixed cash flow ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 20-50
  - **Still need to cover**: Stocks, mutual funds, REITs, ETFs, options, futures, ADRs

    - **Support** = Floor where price bounces UP
      - Buying demand kicks in at this level
      - Acts as floor holding price up
    - **Resistance** = Ceiling where price bounces DOWN
      - Selling pressure kicks in at this level
      - Acts as ceiling holding price down
    - **Breakout** = Price breaks through support or resistance
      - Upward breakout (above resistance) = bullish signal
      - Downward breakout (below support) = bearish signal
    - **Trading Strategies**:
      - Range trading: Buy at support, sell at resistance
      - Breakout trading: Buy when breaks above resistance

  - **Preferred Stock Valuation** (2025-10-24) - MASTERED:
    - Acts like perpetuity (pays fixed dividend forever)
    - **Formula**: Intrinsic Value = Annual Dividend ÷ Required Return
    - Annual Dividend = Par Value × Dividend Yield
    - Intrinsic value ≠ Market price
    - Compare to determine if overvalued or undervalued
    - Perfect on practice problem ($35 par, 7% yield, 9% required = $27.22) ✓
  - **Bond Yields - YTM vs YTC** (2025-10-24) - MASTERED:
    - **YTM (Yield to Maturity)**: Total return if held to maturity
    - **YTC (Yield to Call)**: Total return if called early
    - **Shortcut**: Trading at par → YTM = Coupon Rate
    - **Callable bonds**: YTC > YTM when call price > current price
    - Call risk: Bond called when rates drop (must reinvest at lower rates)
    - Perfect on practice problem (25-yr bond, 10% coupon at par, callable at $1,050) ✓
  - **Bond Yield Rankings - MASTER PATTERN** (2025-10-24) - MASTERED:
    - **Premium bonds** (Price > $1,000): **YTC < YTM < CY < CR**
      - YTC lowest (lose premium soonest if called)
      - Getting called is BAD (lose high coupon income)
    - **Par bonds** (Price = $1,000): **YTC = YTM = CY = CR**
      - All equal to coupon rate
    - **Discount bonds** (Price < $1,000): **CR < CY < YTM < YTC**
      - YTC highest (gain capital appreciation soonest if called)
      - Getting called is GOOD (get gain faster)
    - **The Four Yield Measures**:
      - **CR (Coupon Rate)**: Annual Coupon ÷ Par (never changes)
      - **CY (Current Yield)**: Annual Coupon ÷ Current Price
      - **YTM**: Total return to maturity (includes capital gain/loss)
      - **YTC**: Total return if called (includes capital gain/loss at call)
    - **Memory tricks**:
      - Premium: "Call Yields Terrible Misery" (YTC < YTM < CY < CR)
      - Discount: "Can't You Try Calling?" (CR < CY < YTM < YTC)
      - Par: "Everyone's Equal"
    - Comprehensive understanding demonstrated ✓
  - **Portfolio Immunization** (2025-10-25) - MASTERED:
    - Balances **price risk** and **reinvestment risk**
    - When rates rise: bond prices fall BUT reinvestment income rises (offsetting)
    - When rates fall: bond prices rise BUT reinvestment income falls (offsetting)
    - Match bond duration to liability time horizon
    - **Pension fund example**: 5-year liability, buy 5-year duration bond
    - If rates change, two risks cancel out → still meet liability ✓
    - Perfect on practice problem ✓
  - **Modified Duration** (2025-10-25) - MASTERED:
    - **Two types of duration**:
      - **Macaulay Duration**: Time-weighted measure (in years)
      - **Modified Duration**: Price sensitivity measure
    - **Conversion**: Modified Duration = Macaulay Duration / (1 + yield)
    - **Price change formula**: % Change = -Modified Duration × Δyield
    - **Critical exam trap**: Must convert Macaulay to Modified before using in formula!
    - Example: Macaulay 10 years, yield 8% → Modified = 9.26
    - 2% rate increase → -18.5% price change (NOT -20%!)
    - Student correctly challenged wrong answer ✓
  - **Gordon Growth Model with Retention Ratio** (2025-10-25) - MASTERED:
    - **Retention Ratio**: % of earnings kept (not paid as dividends)
    - **Payout Ratio**: 1 - Retention Ratio
    - **Growth Rate**: g = ROE × Retention Ratio
    - **Gordon Model**: P₀ = D₁ / (r - g)
    - Example: ROE 12.5%, retention 50% → g = 6.25%
    - D₀ $3.50, r 12% → Intrinsic Value = $64.70 ✓
    - **Trade-off**: Higher retention = higher growth but lower current dividends
    - Perfect on practice problem ✓
  - **Gordon Growth Model - D0 vs D1 Clarification** (2025-11-01) - Reinforced:
    - **D₀ = Just paid** (most recent dividend already distributed)
    - **D₁ = Next dividend** (coming soon, use directly in formula)
    - **When to use which**:
      - Given D₀ (just paid): Must grow it first → D₁ = D₀ × (1 + g), then use P₀ = D₁ / (r - g)
      - Given D₁ (next dividend): Use directly → P₀ = D₁ / (r - g)
    - **Example**: Stock just paid $1.64 (D₀), g = 2.25%, r = 7.5%
      - D₁ = $1.64 × 1.0225 = $1.6769
      - Intrinsic Value = $1.6769 / (0.075 - 0.0225) = $31.94 ✓
    - Student practiced this successfully on Mark's stock valuation problem ✓
  - **Multi-Stage Dividend Discount Model** (2025-10-25, 2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **Two-Stage Model**: Different growth rates for different periods
    - **Process**:
      1. Project dividends year by year during high-growth phase
      2. Calculate terminal value at end of high-growth phase
      3. Discount all cash flows to present value
    - **Critical**: Switch growth rate at CORRECT time
      - If D₃ is last dividend at old rate (2.25%), then D₄ is first at new rate (2.75%)
      - Formula: D₄ = D₃ × (1 + new_g) = D₃ × 1.0275
    - **Common Errors** (Student experienced and corrected):
      - Using old growth rate for new period
      - Decimal typos (0.00275 vs 0.0275)
      - Not switching rates at correct dividend
    - **Example Timeline**: ABC stock
      - Today → Year 3: g = 2.25%
      - Year 4+: g = 2.75% (must switch here!)

- [x] **D.30 Quantitative investment concepts** (2025-10-25) - **High confidence** (PARTIAL)
  - **CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)** (2025-10-25) - MASTERED:
    - **Formula**: Required Return = Risk-free Rate + Beta × Market Risk Premium
    - Beta measures stock volatility vs market
    - Beta > 1: More volatile than market (requires higher return)
    - Beta < 1: Less volatile than market (requires lower return)
    - Beta = 1: Same as market
    - **NOT an equation to solve for x** - formula directly gives required return
    - Example: Beta 1.20, RF 1%, MRP 7% → Required Return = 9.4% ✓
    - Perfect on practice problem ✓
  - **Risk-Adjusted Performance Ratios** (2025-10-25, 2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **"S-T-A" Memory System** for non-English speakers:
      - **S**harpe uses **S**tandard deviation
      - **T**reynor uses be**T**a
      - **A**lpha = **A**ctual vs Expected
    - **Sharpe Ratio** = (Return - Risk-free) / Standard Deviation
      - Measures return per unit of TOTAL risk
      - Use when: Comparing funds with different risk levels ✓
      - Example: Fund C had 0.35 (best) vs Fund A 0.33, Fund B 0.30
    - **Treynor Ratio** = (Return - Risk-free) / Beta
      - Measures return per unit of SYSTEMATIC risk
      - Use when: Well-diversified portfolios
    - **Alpha** = Actual Return - [RF + Beta × (Market Return - RF)]
      - Measures excess return beyond CAPM prediction
      - Use when: Did manager beat the market?
    - **Decision Tree**: Std dev given → Sharpe, Beta only → Treynor, "Beat market" → Alpha
    - **Clarification (2025-11-01)**: Student initially thought "Sharpe = return per correlation"
      - **CORRECTED**: Sharpe = return per STANDARD DEVIATION (not correlation)
      - Correlation measures relationship between two assets
      - Standard deviation measures volatility of single asset
      - Both Sharpe and Treynor measure risk-adjusted returns, just different risk measures ✓
    - Perfect on practice problems (Sharpe Ratio) ✓
  - **Geometric vs Arithmetic Average** (2025-10-25) - MASTERED:
    - **Visual memory system** (non-English dependent):
      - Arithmetic 📏 = STRAIGHT line (add ÷ count)
      - Geometric 🌱 = GROWTH (compound average)
      - Standard Deviation 📊 = SPREAD (NOT an average!)
      - Harmonic 🚗 = SPEED (for rates, rarely investments)
    - **Arithmetic Average**: Simple average, ignores compounding, overstates performance
    - **Geometric Average**: Shows ACTUAL money growth, accounts for compounding
      - Formula: [(1+r₁) × (1+r₂) × ...]^(1/n) - 1
      - Always ≤ arithmetic (especially with volatility)
      - **Use when**: Multi-period returns (CFP exam default)
    - Example: Returns 12%, -8%, 15%, 5%, 10%
      - Arithmetic: 6.8%
      - Geometric: 6.47% (more accurate) ✓
    - Perfect on practice problem ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 60-75 (HPR, IRR, Standard deviation, Beta, Sharpe/Treynor/Jensen, NPV)
  - **Still need to cover**: Standard deviation calculations, NPV/IRR calculations

### ✅ Mastered Topics (9/9) - DOMAIN COMPLETE ✅

- [x] **D.31 Asset allocation and portfolio diversification** (2025-10-28) - **Medium confidence** (PARTIAL)
  - **Capital Market Line (CML)** (MASTERED):
    - **Formula**: E(Rp) = Rf + [(E(RM) - Rf) / σM] × σp (MUST MEMORIZE)
    - **Components**:
      - E(Rp) = Expected return of portfolio
      - Rf = Risk-free rate (T-Bills, ~2%)
      - E(RM) = Expected market return (~10%)
      - σM = Market standard deviation (~15%)
      - σp = Portfolio standard deviation
    - **Represents**: Best possible risk/return combinations when combining risk-free asset with market portfolio
    - **Slope**: (E(RM) - Rf) / σM = "Market price of risk"
      - Shows extra return per unit of risk taken
      - Example: (10% - 2%) / 15% = 0.533 (0.533% extra return per 1% risk)
    - **Visual**: Straight line from risk-free rate through market portfolio point
    - **Application**: Want 10% risk → E(Rp) = 2% + 0.533 × 10% = 7.33% return
    - **Portfolio mix**: Combine percentages of T-Bills and market portfolio to achieve target risk
    - Perfect conceptual understanding, needs practice problems ✓

### ✅ Mastered Topics (6/8)

- [x] **E.36 Tax law fundamentals** (2025-10-11, 2025-10-25, 2025-11-01, 2025-11-02) - **High confidence**
  - Tax doctrines: Step transaction, Constructive receipt, Assignment of income
  - **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) - Property Tax Treatment** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **Property Taxes and AMT**:
      - Regular tax: State/local property taxes DEDUCTIBLE (up to $10K SALT cap)
      - AMT: State/local taxes NOT deductible (add-back item under IRC §56(b)(1)(A)(ii))
    - **The Trap**: Prepaying property taxes when IN AMT
      - Prepaying seems smart (accelerate deduction to current year)
      - But in AMT: You DON'T get the deduction anyway!
      - Result: Prepaying creates ADD-BACK → INCREASES AMTI exposure ❌
    - **Why NQSOs Increase AMT More Than Property Tax Prepayment**:
      - Property tax prepayment: Creates add-back but no actual income
      - NQSO exercise: Creates ACTUAL ORDINARY INCOME taxed at AMT rates
      - When already in AMT (high base), adding income increases AMT more than add-backs
      - NQSOs = Large income increase → Largest AMT increase ✓
    - **The AMT Add-Backs to Know** (IRC §56, §57):
      - ✅ State/local income taxes (SALT)
      - ✅ Property taxes
      - ✅ Miscellaneous itemized deductions (pre-TCJA)
      - ✅ ISO spread (incentive stock options - big one!)
      - ❌ Charitable contributions (NOT added back)
      - ❌ Mortgage interest on primary residence (NOT added back)
    - **Memory System**: "AMT SALT Trap"
      - **A**MT doesn't allow state/local/property taxes
      - **M**unicipals are ok (usually)
      - **T**axes = add-back
      - **S**o prepaying doesn't help
      - **A**dds to AMTI
      - **L**ose the deduction
      - **T**axed twice (paid tax, no benefit)
    - Student initially selected prepaying property taxes thinking it helps avoid AMT ✓
    - Now understands: Property taxes NOT deductible for AMT, prepaying increases exposure ✓
  - **Divorced Parent Dependency Rules - IRC §152(e)** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **Custodial Parent Rule**: Custodial parent (more nights with child) claims dependency exemption by DEFAULT
    - **Overrides financial support**: True even if non-custodial parent provides MORE $ support
    - **Why**: Custodial parent has day-to-day expenses (food, utilities, housing, time-based costs)
    - **IRS Presumption**: Custodial parent deemed to provide >50% support
    - **Form 8332 - Release of Claim to Exemption**:
      - ONLY way to change the default rule
      - Custodial parent must sign written release to non-custodial parent
      - Both parents attach Form 8332 to tax returns
      - Without Form 8332, custody ALWAYS wins (support % irrelevant)
    - **Key Trap**: Financial support percentage does NOT determine who claims dependent in divorce situations
    - **Example**: Ruth (custodial parent) vs Doug (provides 75% support, $15K/year)
      - No Form 8332 written agreement → Ruth claims both children ✓
      - Doug's higher support doesn't matter under IRC §152(e)
    - **Normal Dependency vs Divorce Rule**:
      - Normal: Whoever provides >50% support claims dependent
      - Divorce: Custodial parent claims (regardless of support %), unless Form 8332
    - **Memory System**: "CUSTODY WINS (unless released)"
      - Custodial parent gets dependency by default
      - Unless Form 8332 signed (written release)
      - Support % doesn't matter (special divorce rule)
    - Perfect understanding ✓
  - **Municipal Bond Taxation** (2025-10-25) - MASTERED:
    - Municipal bonds have TWO types of income:
      1. **INTEREST income** (coupon payments):
         - Federal tax: **EXEMPT** (tax-free)
         - State tax: **EXEMPT if home state resident** (triple-tax-free if local)
      2. **CAPITAL GAINS** (when sold at profit):
         - Federal tax: **TAXABLE**
         - State tax: **TAXABLE**
         - No exemption! Capital gains fully taxable even on munis
    - **Corrected misconception**: Student thought munis avoided all federal tax
    - **Key insight**: Interest tax-free, but capital gains ARE taxable
    - This distinction critical for capital loss offset strategies ✓
  - **Treasury Bond Taxation**:
    - INTEREST: Federal taxable, state exempt
    - CAPITAL GAINS: Fully taxable (both levels)
  - **In slides**: Pages 1-15

- [x] **E.37 Income tax calculations** (2025-10-11, 2025-10-19, 2025-10-24, 2025-11-02) - **High confidence**
  - Capital gains/losses netting rules
  - Tax rates: 0%/15%/20% for LTCG
  - Perfect execution on calculations
  - **Kiddie Tax (IRC §1(g)) and UGMA/UTMA** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **UGMA/UTMA Basics**:
      - NOT a trust - It's a CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT
      - Child OWNS the assets (irrevocable gift)
      - Custodian manages until age of majority (18-21, depends on state)
      - Income reported on CHILD'S tax return (not trust Form 1041)
      - Child's SSN used
    - **Kiddie Tax (IRC §1(g))** applies to:
      - Children under 19 (or under 24 if full-time student)
      - Unearned income (interest, dividends, capital gains)
    - **2024 Kiddie Tax Thresholds**:
      - First $1,300: Tax-free (standard deduction for unearned income)
      - Next $1,300: Taxed at child's rate (usually 10%)
      - **Amount over $2,600**: Taxed at PARENT'S marginal rate ✓
    - **Form 8615 Required** when:
      - Child under 19 (or under 24 if student)
      - Unearned income > $2,600
      - At least one parent alive
    - **Example - Fred & Sarah** (2025-11-02):
      - $5,000 interest income in UGMA
      - First $1,300: $0 tax (standard deduction)
      - Next $1,300: Taxed at Sarah's rate (10%) = $130
      - Remaining $2,400: Taxed at Fred's marginal rate (e.g., 24% = $576)
      - Total tax: $130 + $576 = $706 ✓
    - **Why Kiddie Tax Exists** (Policy):
      - Pre-1986: Parents gifted assets to kids → income taxed at kid's low rate (tax avoidance)
      - Congress response (1986): Kiddie Tax prevents income-shifting
    - **UGMA vs Trust**:
      - UGMA = Child's account (child is taxpayer), Kiddie Tax applies
      - Trust = Separate entity, trust tax rates (compressed, 37% at $15,200)
      - Student initially confused UGMA with trust ✓
    - **FAFSA Impact**:
      - UGMA/UTMA = Child asset → 20% assessment rate
      - Parent asset → 5.64% assessment rate
      - $10,000 in UGMA → Reduces aid by $2,000/year
    - **Memory System**:
      - "UGMA = Under Grantor's Management, Asset's child's"
      - "Kiddie Tax: $1,300 Free, $1,300 Kid, Rest to MOM & DAD"
      - "UGMA = 20% FAFSA hit"
    - Perfect understanding ✓
  - **Estimated tax safe harbor rules** (2025-10-19) - MASTERED:
    - 100% prior year if AGI ≤ $150K, 110% if > $150K
    - OR 90% of current year
    - Use LESSER amount to avoid penalty
    - Perfect on lottery winnings problem ✓
  - **OID (Original Issue Discount) Taxation - Zero-Coupon Bonds** (2025-10-24) - MASTERED:
    - OID = Par value - Purchase price
    - Must use **compound interest accretion** (NOT straight-line)
    - Calculate implied YTM first: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n
    - Each year: Taxable interest = Beginning value × YTM
    - Taxable amount increases each year (compound growth)
    - **Phantom income**: Pay tax on money not received
    - Example: $445 bond → $1,000 in 10 years at 8.41% YTM
      - Year 1: $445 × 8.41% = $37.42 tax
      - Year 2: $482.42 × 8.41% = $40.57 tax
    - Common trap: Straight-line would be ($1,000 - $445) ÷ 10 = $55.50 (WRONG!)
    - Perfect on practice problem (Year 2 taxable interest calculation) ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 20-50 (Filing status, Standard deduction, Gross income, Kiddie tax, AMT)

- [x] **E.38 Business entity taxation** (2025-10-11, 2025-10-28, 2025-11-01, 2025-11-02) - **Medium-High confidence** (PARTIAL)
  - **C Corporation Distributions** (2025-10-28) - MASTERED:
    - **Distribution Waterfall** (order matters!):
      1. **Dividend income** - Up to Earnings & Profits (E&P) amount
      2. **Return of basis** - Tax-free, reduces shareholder's stock basis
      3. **Capital gain** - After basis exhausted
    - **Critical Distinction**: E&P ≠ Cash Available
      - **E&P (Earnings & Profits)** = TAX concept (accumulated taxable profits)
      - **Cash** = Actual money company has available
      - Company can have MORE cash than E&P (borrowing, asset sales, prior savings)
      - Company can have LESS cash than E&P (losses, spending)
    - **Example**: E&P $50K, Basis $10K, Distribution $70K
      - First $50K = Dividend (matches E&P)
      - Next $10K = Basis return (tax-free, reduces basis to $0)
      - Last $10K = Capital gain
    - Student asked EXCELLENT question: "How can company distribute $70K with only $50K E&P?" ✓
    - Perfect understanding of waterfall mechanics ✓
  - **Section 1221 vs Section 1231 Property** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **IRC §1221 - Definition of Capital Asset** (what IS a capital asset):
      - **Rule**: Everything is a capital asset EXCEPT what §1221 specifically excludes
      - **What §1221 EXCLUDES** (NOT capital assets):
        1. Inventory or stock in trade (goods held for sale to customers)
        2. Depreciable property used in business
        3. Real estate used in business
        4. Accounts/notes receivable from business operations
        5. Creative works (copyrights, compositions) held by creator
        6. Dealer property (commodities, hedging transactions)
      - **Memory Aid**: "§1221 Says NO" (defines what's NOT a capital asset)
    - **IRC §1231 - Special Business Property Treatment** (what GETS preferential treatment):
      - **What §1231 INCLUDES** (gets special tax treatment):
        - Depreciable property used in business (held >1 year)
        - Real estate used in business (held >1 year)
        - Livestock (held for draft, dairy, breeding)
        - Unharvested crops sold with land
      - **The Magic**: If §1231 property sold:
        - **Net gain** → Taxed as LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAIN (15-20%, favorable!)
        - **Net loss** → Deducted as ORDINARY LOSS (against ordinary income, better!)
        - "Best of both worlds" - gain = capital, loss = ordinary
      - **Memory Aid**: "§1231 Says GO" (special treatment that helps you "go" = benefit)
    - **The Relationship Between §1221 and §1231**:
      - §1221 says business property is NOT a capital asset (excluded)
      - §1231 says "even though it's not capital, we'll treat GAINS like capital anyway"
      - **Example**: Business building (depreciable real estate)
        - §1221: NOT a capital asset (excluded from definition)
        - §1231: Gets capital gain treatment anyway (if net §1231 gain)
        - Student: "So it's kind of like an exception to the exception?" → YES! Exactly! ✓
    - **Lisa's Business Assets Example** (2025-11-01):
      - Warehouse (depreciable real estate) → §1231 property ✓
      - Machinery (depreciable equipment) → §1231 property ✓
      - Inventory → NOT §1231 (it's ordinary property)
      - **Rule**: §1231 = depreciable business property + business real estate (held >1 year)
    - Perfect understanding of distinction and interaction ✓
  - **Depreciation vs Amortization** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **Key Distinction**: DIFFERENT tax methods for DIFFERENT asset types
    - **Depreciation (IRC §167, §168 MACRS)**:
      - For **TANGIBLE** assets (physical, can touch)
      - Examples: Buildings, equipment, vehicles, computers, furniture
      - MACRS accelerated method or straight-line
      - Recovery periods: 5, 7, 15, 27.5, or 39 years
      - Can use Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation
    - **Amortization (IRC §197)**:
      - For **INTANGIBLE** assets (no physical form, intellectual property)
      - Examples: Copyrights, trademarks, patents, goodwill, customer lists, covenants not to compete
      - 15-year straight-line recovery (usually)
      - NO Section 179, NO bonus depreciation
      - Starts month acquired
    - **Baxter's Assets Categorized** (2025-11-02):
      - Trademark & Copyright: INTANGIBLE → ✅ AMORTIZABLE (IRC §197, 15 years)
      - Office Building: TANGIBLE → DEPRECIABLE (39-year MACRS), NOT amortizable
      - Computers: TANGIBLE → DEPRECIABLE (5-year MACRS), NOT amortizable
      - Land: NEVER depreciable or amortizable (doesn't wear out)
    - **The Rule**: Can you TOUCH it? → Depreciate. Can't touch it (idea/right)? → Amortize
    - **Why Different Terms?**:
      - Both recover cost over time (same goal)
      - But different tax rules based on asset type
      - Tangible wears out physically → depreciation rules
      - Intangible has legal/economic life → amortization rules
      - NOT interchangeable terms!
    - **Memory System**: "D.A.T.I. Rule"
      - **D**epreciation for **T**angible
      - **A**mortization for **I**ntangible
    - **Drop Test**: "If you can DROP IT on your foot → DEPRECIATE. If you can't DROP IT (not physical) → AMORTIZE"
    - Student initially confused office building (thought amortizable) ✓
    - Now understands: Buildings = tangible = depreciable, NOT amortizable ✓
    - Perfect clarity on distinction ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 135-145
  - **Still need to cover**: Section 179 expensing, MACRS depreciation, Mid-quarter convention
  - **Action**: Study Section 179/MACRS with fresh mind (HIGH PRIORITY GAP still exists)

- [x] **E.40 Tax reduction techniques** (2025-10-11, 2025-10-19, 2025-10-25, 2025-11-02) - **High confidence**
  - Traditional IRA contributions & deductions
  - Roth IRA strategy
  - QCD (Qualified Charitable Distributions)
  - Active participant phase-outs
  - **Bad Debt Deduction Requirements (IRC §166)** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - To deduct non-business bad debt (as short-term capital loss), loan must be:
      1. **Bona fide debt** - True debt, not a gift
      2. **Legal obligation to repay** - Unconditional promise (NOT contingent!)
      3. **Reasonable expectation of repayment** - Lender expected to be repaid
      4. **Became worthless** during the tax year
      5. **Previously included in income** OR basis in the debt
    - **The Contingent Repayment Problem**:
      - "Pay me back IF business succeeds" = NOT legal obligation ❌
      - "Pay me back IF I get inheritance" = NOT legal obligation ❌
      - IRS views contingent repayment as part gift, part loan
      - If business fails → Borrower had NO obligation → NOT deductible
    - **The Family Loan Problem**:
      - IRS presumes family loans are GIFTS (not debts) unless proven
      - Must PROVE with:
        - Written promissory note
        - Stated interest rate (at least AFR - Applicable Federal Rate)
        - Repayment schedule
        - Collateral or security (if applicable)
        - Actual efforts to collect
      - No written agreement + family relationship = presumed gift ❌
    - **Example - Mother-Daughter Loan** (2025-11-02):
      - $50,000 loan for business, contingent on business succeeding
      - FAILS "Legal Obligation" test (contingent repayment)
      - If business fails, daughter had NO duty to repay
      - NOT deductible if becomes worthless ❌
    - **Example - Friend Loan with Written Agreement** (2025-11-02):
      - $20,000 for investment, written agreement + interest charged
      - PASSES all tests:
        - Written agreement = bona fide debt ✓
        - Interest charged = economic substance (not gift) ✓
        - Unconditional repayment = legal obligation ✓
      - If worthless → Deductible as short-term capital loss ($3K/year limit) ✓
    - **Tax Treatment if Deductible**:
      - Non-business bad debt → SHORT-TERM CAPITAL LOSS (regardless of how long held)
      - Limited to $3,000/year against ordinary income
      - Excess carries forward indefinitely
      - Example: $20K bad debt → Year 1: -$3K, Year 2: -$3K, etc.
    - **Memory System**:
      - "DEBT = Documented, Economic substance, Binding obligation, True expectation"
      - "Family Loans Need WRITE Terms": Written, Reasonable rate, Independent terms, Timeline, Enforcement
      - "Contingent = Gift-scent": If repayment is contingent, IRS smells a gift
    - Student initially selected contingent mother-daughter loan ✓
    - Now understands: Contingent repayment = NOT deductible ✓
  - **Tax credits vs tax deductions** (2025-10-19) - MASTERED:
    - Tax credit = dollar-for-dollar reduction ($355 credit = $355 savings)
    - Tax deduction = reduces taxable income (value × marginal rate)
    - $1,000 deduction in 32% bracket = only $320 savings
    - Credits ALWAYS beat equal-dollar deductions ✓
  - **Child support not deductible** (2025-10-19) - tax-neutral
  - **Capital Loss Carryover** (2025-10-25) - MASTERED:
    - Short-term capital loss can offset ANY capital gain (ST or LT)
    - To reduce capital loss carryover, need CAPITAL GAIN income
    - **Critical tax treatments**:
      - Market discount on bonds (buy at discount, hold to par) = **ordinary income** (NOT capital gain)
      - OID on zero-coupon bonds (held to maturity) = **ordinary income** (NOT capital gain)
      - Annuity gains = **ordinary income** (NOT capital gain)
      - Municipal bond sold at premium = **CAPITAL GAIN** (taxable!) ✓
    - **Only capital gains can offset capital loss carryover**
    - Student's excellent reasoning: "B definitely gives you more" ✓
    - Perfect on practice problem ✓
  - **Capital losses** (2025-10-19): Offset up to $3,000 ordinary income/year
  - **In slides**: Pages 60-90 (Deductions FOR/FROM AGI, Itemized, Pass-through 199A)

- [x] **E.41 Property transactions** (2025-10-18, 2025-10-28, 2025-11-02) - **High confidence**
  - Passive activity losses: $25K exception, AGI phase-outs
  - **Vacation Rental Expense Allocation (IRC §280A)** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **Classification Test** (determines if property qualifies as rental):
      - Rented ≥ 15 days AND Personal use ≤ 14 days OR ≤ 10% of rental days → **Rental Property**
      - Can deduct expenses (subject to allocation formula)
    - **Expense Allocation Formula**:
      - Deductible % = Rental Days ÷ (Rental Days + Personal Days)
      - **CRITICAL**: Vacant days NOT included in denominator (not personal use!)
    - **Brenda's Example** (2025-11-02):
      - 355 rental days, 10 personal days, $5,000 expenses
      - Classification: 10 days < 14 AND < 35.5 (10% × 355) → Qualifies as rental ✓
      - Deductible %: 355 ÷ (355 + 10) = 97.26%
      - Deduction: $5,000 × 97.26% = $4,863 ✓
    - **Student's BRILLIANT Question** (2025-11-02):
      - "If 10 days were vacant (not personal use), could deduct full $5,000?"
      - **Answer: YES!** If vacant instead of personal use:
        - Personal days = 0, Vacant days = 10
        - Deductible % = 355 ÷ (355 + 0) = 100%
        - Full $5,000 deduction ✓
      - **Why**: Vacant days = property held for rental but temporarily unoccupied
        - No personal benefit from vacant days → no reduction in deduction
        - Like landlord with apartment vacant between tenants
    - **The Key Distinction**: USED days matter, VACANT days don't
      - Formula only includes days actually USED (rental + personal)
      - Vacant/unoccupied days ignored (not personal use)
      - Only personal use reduces deduction
    - **Memory System**: "USED Days Matter, VACANT Days Don't"
    - Student demonstrated exceptional critical thinking identifying vacant vs personal use distinction ✓
  - **1031 Like-Kind Exchanges** - EXCELLENT:
    - Boot = Cash received + Debt relief not replaced ✓
    - Balanced equation: What you give up = What you get ✓
    - Basis formula: Old basis - Boot + Gain recognized ✓
    - Perfect on practice problem ($300K boot) ✓
  - **Section 1245 vs Section 1250 Depreciation Recapture** (2025-10-28) - MASTERED:
    - **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**:
      - **Section 1245** (Equipment, Machinery, Furniture):
        - Recapture = **ORDINARY INCOME** (35-37% tax rate)
        - ALL recognized in year of sale (cannot defer with installment)
        - "Government is GREEDY" - no mercy!
      - **Section 1250** (Buildings, Real Estate with straight-line):
        - Recapture = **"Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain"** (still "capital gain")
        - Taxed at **25%** rate (not ordinary 35%+)
        - CAN defer with installment sale
        - "Government is NICER to real estate"
    - **Three "Capital Gain" Rates** (student correctly identified as "messed up"):
      - 0%/15%/20% = Regular long-term capital gain
      - 25% = Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain (building depreciation)
      - 28% = Collectibles gain
    - **Installment Sale Mechanics**:
      - **Gross profit %** = (Sale price - Adjusted basis) ÷ Contract price
      - Apply % to each payment to determine gain recognized
      - Example: $250K sale, $30K basis → $220K gain ÷ $250K = 88% gross profit %
      - 20% down payment ($50K) × 88% = $44K gain in Year 1 ✓
    - **Section 1250 composition**:
      - Depreciation recapture portion taxed at 25%
      - Appreciation portion taxed at 15-20%
      - Both spread over installment payments
    - Student validated in frustration about tax complexity ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 10-40 (Basis, Capital gains, Section 1244, Section 1202, Nontaxable exchanges, Depreciation recapture)

- [x] **E.43 Charitable contributions** (2025-10-11, 2025-10-19, 2025-11-02) - **High confidence**
  - QCD tax treatment (exclusion from income vs deduction)
  - **Related use rule for tangible personal property** (2025-10-19) - MASTERED:
    - Charity KEEPS/USES = deduct Fair Market Value
    - Charity SELLS = deduct LESSER of (basis OR FMV)
    - Antique vase problem: Charity sold it = deduct $1,700 basis only ✓
    - Prevents deducting gains charity actually received ✓
  - **Pooled Income Fund** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **What it IS**:
      - Charity creates and maintains fund
      - Pools commingled donations from many donors
      - Donors get income for life (proportional to contribution)
      - Remainder goes to charity (irrevocably earmarked)
    - **CRITICAL RESTRICTION: Cannot invest in tax-free municipal bonds** ❌
      - IRS prohibition on tax-exempt securities
      - Prevents "double tax benefit" (charitable deduction + tax-free income)
      - Donor already got charitable deduction (benefit #1)
      - **IRS rule**: "You got tax break, now pay tax on income"
    - **Student's EXCELLENT Question** (2025-11-02):
      - "But tax-free investments have lower returns, why ban them?"
      - **Answer**: Student economically RIGHT (munis often worse after-tax)!
      - IRS rule is about PRINCIPLE, not economics
      - Prevent 100% tax-free income (even if smaller amount)
    - **Allowed Investments**: Stocks, corporate bonds, real estate
    - **NOT Allowed**: Municipal bonds, tax-exempt securities
    - **Memory**: "No DOUBLE-Dipping" (deduction + tax-free income)

### ✅ Mastered Topics (9/10)

- [x] **F.45 Social Security and Medicare** - **High confidence**

  **Social Security** (2025-10-16, 2025-10-21, 2025-10-29):
  - Filing timeline: Early/FRA/Delayed
  - Earnings test: $22,320 threshold ($1 for $2), $59,520 FRA year ($1 for $3)
  - Taxation: Combined income, up to 85% taxable
  - **Spousal Benefits with Early Filing** (2025-10-21) - MASTERED:
    - Spousal benefit: 50% of spouse's PIA (if higher than own PIA)
    - **Deemed filing rule**: Filing before FRA = automatic filing for all benefits
    - **Reduction rates DIFFER**:
      - Own benefit: 5/9 of 1% per month (6.67% for 12 months early)
      - Spousal benefit: 25/36 of 1% per month (8.33% for 12 months early)
    - **Calculation**: Own reduced benefit + reduced spousal supplement
    - Example: PIA $1,500, spouse PIA $3,600 → Total $1,680 ($1,400 own + $275 spousal)
  - **Fully Insured vs Currently Insured Status** (2025-10-29) - MASTERED:
    - **Fully Insured (MAIN status)**:
      - Formula: Credits needed = Age - 22 (minimum 6, maximum 40)
      - Based on LIFETIME work credits
      - Gets: ALL benefits (retirement, survivor, disability)
      - Example: Age 29 needs 7 credits (29-22)
    - **Currently Insured (BACKUP status)**:
      - Rule: Need 6 of last 13 quarters (3.25 years)
      - Based on RECENT work only
      - Gets: LIMITED survivor benefits (if not fully insured)
      - Rarely matters once fully insured
    - **Work history gaps**:
      - Hurt "currently insured" (recent work requirement)
      - May not hurt "fully insured" (lifetime credits count)
      - Example: 4 years work, 4 years grad school, 1 year work = 16 total credits (fully ✓) but only 4 recent (currently ✗)
    - **Why two statuses exist**: Currently insured protects young workers who die before earning enough lifetime credits
    - Student noted: "This is tricky" - accurate assessment! ✓
  - **In slides**: Pages 165-175
  - ⚠️ **Minor gap**: Early filing reduction % (thinks 5%, actually 5/9 then 5/12) - being resolved

  **Medicare** (comprehensive deep dive 2025-10-18):
  - All Parts A/B/C/D details mastered
  - MA vs Medigap tradeoffs understood
  - Enrollment periods, commissions, coverage limits ✓
  - **Gap resolved** from Medium to HIGH confidence

- [x] **F.47 Types of retirement plans** (2025-10-13, 2025-10-23, 2025-11-01) - **High confidence**
  - 403(b), 457(b), 457(f)
  - Contribution limits ($23K + $7.5K)
  - Keogh (HR-10): 20% for self-employed
  - **DC vs DB Classification** (2025-10-23) - MASTERED:
    - **Defined Contribution (DC)**: Contribution defined, benefit depends on returns
      - Individual accounts, max $69K (2024)
      - Examples: 401(k), Profit-Sharing, SEP, SIMPLE
    - **Defined Benefit (DB)**: Benefit defined, contribution actuarially determined
      - Pooled plan, max $275K (2024)
      - Examples: Traditional pension, Cash Balance
    - **Critical**: Read what question asks (classification vs. best plan vs. highest contribution)
  - **Target Benefit Plans** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **What it is**: Hybrid between DB and DC plans
      - TARGET benefit (hoped for, NOT guaranteed like DB)
      - Individual accounts (employee bears investment risk like DC)
      - Age-weighted contributions (older employees get MUCH more)
      - Cheaper than traditional DB (no PBGC insurance, simpler admin)
    - **Key Concept: Age-Weighting Favors Older Employees**
      - Example targeting $50K/year at age 65:
        - Age 30 (35 years left): $5,000/year contribution (5% of salary)
        - Age 45 (20 years left): $15,000/year contribution (15% of salary)
        - Age 55 (10 years left): $40,000/year contribution (40% of salary) ✅
      - Less time to accumulate → need larger contributions
    - **Perfect Client Profile**:
      - Small business owner age 50-62
      - High income, wants to maximize own contributions
      - Other key employees are also older (50+)
      - Young employees are low-paid (age-weighting minimizes their share)
      - Can't afford traditional DB plan costs
    - **When NOT to use**:
      - Large publicly held corporations (use 401k instead)
      - Young executives (age-weighting works against them)
      - Companies wanting to favor rank-and-file workers
    - **Memory Aid**: "Target Benefit = Old Guys Win"
    - Student initially thought it favored young employees (common trap!) ✓
    - Now understands age-weighting concept perfectly ✓
  - **Retirement Plan Selection Patterns** (2025-10-23) - MASTERED:
    - **"Flexible contributions"** → Rules out DB plans (actuarially required)
    - **"Employee retention"** → Need vesting schedules (rules out SEP, SIMPLE)
    - **"Maximize owner contributions"** → DB plans or high DC limits
    - Safe Harbor 401(k) = base 3% + discretionary profit-sharing (true flexibility)
  - **In slides**: Pages 10-40 (DB vs DC, Pension vs Profit-sharing, All plan types)

- [x] **F.48 Qualified plan rules** (2025-10-11, 2025-10-20, 2025-10-23, 2025-10-29, 2025-11-02) - **High confidence**
  - DC vs DB plans
  - Pension vs profit-sharing
  - Cash balance, target benefit, money purchase
  - **Social Security Integration - Plans That CANNOT Integrate** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **The Three Plans That CANNOT Integrate - "SSE"**:
      - **S**ARSEP (grandfathered since 1996, too simple)
      - **S**IMPLE IRA (designed to be SIMPLE, fixed 2% or 3% match formulas)
      - **E**SOP (stock ownership plan, not retirement income replacement)
    - **Plans That CAN Integrate**:
      - ✅ Profit-sharing plans (the correct answer!)
      - ✅ Traditional pension plans (defined benefit)
      - ✅ Money purchase plans
      - ✅ 401(k) plans
      - ✅ Target benefit plans
    - **Why These Three Cannot**:
      - **SIMPLE**: Name says it - Keep it SIMPLE, no complexity allowed
        - Fixed formulas only (2% nonelective OR dollar-for-dollar up to 3% match)
        - Can't layer integration formulas on top
      - **SARSEP**: Grandfathered (no new after 1996), too simple for integration
      - **ESOP**: Allocates company STOCK, not cash contributions
        - Purpose is employee ownership, not retirement income optimization
        - Integration doesn't make sense for stock allocation
    - **What is Social Security Integration?** (Permitted Disparity):
      - Allows higher contributions for employees above SS wage base ($168,600 for 2024)
      - Rationale: SS taxes only apply up to wage base
      - Integration "evens out" total benefits
      - Maximum disparity: 5.7% for DC plans
    - **Memory System**:
      - "SSE Cannot Integrate" (SARSEP, SIMPLE, ESOP)
      - "SIMPLE Stays SIMPLE" (no integration complexity)
      - "Everything else CAN integrate"
    - Student initially selected SIMPLE IRA thinking it would integrate ✓
    - Now understands: SSE = the three plans that cannot integrate ✓
  - **Nondiscrimination Coverage Testing (IRC §410(b))** (2025-10-29) - MASTERED:
    - **Purpose**: Ensure plans don't only benefit highly paid employees
    - **Two tests available**:
      - **Ratio Percentage Test**: (% NHCEs benefitting) ÷ (% HCEs benefitting) ≥ 70%
        - Example: 90% HCEs participate → need 63% NHCEs minimum (70% × 90%)
      - **Average Benefits Test**: (Avg benefit % NHCEs) ÷ (Avg benefit % HCEs) ≥ 70%
        - Example: HCEs get 12% of comp → NHCEs need 8.4% minimum (70% × 12%)
    - **CRITICAL DIRECTION**: Protected group (NHCEs) must be 70% of advantaged group (HCEs)
      - **NEVER backwards!** Not HCE ÷ NHCE (would protect bosses, not workers)
      - Formula pattern: NHCE amount ÷ HCE amount ≥ 70%
    - **HCEs vs Key Employees** (different definitions):
      - **HCEs** (for coverage testing): Earned >$155K (2024) OR >5% owner
      - **Key Employees** (for top-heavy testing): Officers >$220K, >5% owners, >1% owners earning >$150K
      - Common exam trap: Questions use wrong employee classification
    - Memory trick: Disadvantaged group must get 70% of what advantaged group gets
  - **Permitted Disparity / Social Security Integration** (2025-10-20) - MASTERED:
    - Also called "Social Security Integration"
    - Allows extra benefits to higher-paid employees
    - **EXCESS METHOD** (two-tier): Higher contribution/benefit on wages above threshold
      - DB can use: Tier benefit percentages
      - DC can use: Tier contribution percentages
    - **OFFSET METHOD** (subtract SS): Reduce promised benefit by portion of Social Security
      - DB can use: Has promised benefit to reduce
      - DC CANNOT use: No promised benefit to offset!
    - **Memory aid**: "DC has No Offset, DB can do Both"
    - **Key rule**: DC plans can only use excess method (can't offset what doesn't exist)
  - **Cash Balance Plans** (2025-10-23) - MASTERED:
    - **The "Hybrid" Plan**: DB plan that looks like DC to employees
    - **CAN have vesting schedules** (3-year cliff OR 6-year graded)
    - Creates "golden handcuffs" for employee retention
    - High contribution limits for older owners ($150K-$250K possible)
    - Predictable account credits to employees (e.g., 5% pay + 4% interest annually)
    - **vs SEP IRA**: SEP has 100% immediate vesting required (no retention tool)
    - **Perfect for**: Small business, older owner, want retention + high contributions
  - **Vesting as Retention Tool** (2025-10-23):
    - SEP IRA: 100% immediate vesting REQUIRED (no retention)
    - SIMPLE IRA: 100% immediate vesting REQUIRED (no retention)
    - 401(k) Safe Harbor: Safe harbor immediate, but profit-sharing can vest (2-6 yrs)
    - Cash Balance: Can use 3-yr cliff or 6-yr graded vesting
    - **Key pattern**: "Employee retention" objective → need vesting schedules
  - **In slides**: Pages 20-60 (Qualification, Coverage tests, Vesting, Top-heavy, ADP/ACP)

- [x] **F.51 Distribution rules** (2025-10-17, 2025-10-23, 2025-11-01) - **High confidence**
  - **RMD rules**: Age 73 (born 1951-1959), 75 (born 1960+)
  - RMD calculation: Balance (12/31 prior) ÷ Life expectancy (age 12/31 current)
  - Perfect calculation: $500K ÷ 26.5 = $18,868 ✓
  - April 1 delay for first RMD only
  - 25% penalty (10% if corrected)
  - Roth IRAs: No RMD during lifetime
  - **Early Withdrawal Penalty Exceptions** (2025-10-23, 2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **CRITICAL #1 EXAM TRAP: HARDSHIP ≠ EXCEPTION!** (2025-11-02):
      - **Most common mistake**: Thinking hardship withdrawals avoid 10% penalty
      - **Reality**: Hardship withdrawals STILL subject to 10% penalty (if under 59½)!
      - You can ACCESS the money (hardship allows withdrawal)
      - But you PAY the penalty (10% + regular tax)
      - **Memory**: "HARDSHIP is HARD on your wallet - you still pay 10%"
    - **The Main Exceptions - "D³ + 55 = FREE"** (2025-11-02):
      - **D¹ = DEATH**: Beneficiary receives after participant dies (no penalty)
      - **D² = DISABILITY**: Totally and permanently disabled (no penalty)
      - **D³ = Distributions after 59½**: Magic age (no penalty)
      - **55 = Rule of 55**: Separated from service at age 55+ (NOT in-service!)
    - **Rule of 55 CRITICAL Requirement** (2025-10-23, 2025-11-02):
      - Must SEPARATE from service (quit/fired) at age 55 or later
      - **In-service = Rule doesn't apply!** (Still working = no exception yet)
      - Example: Age 55, in-service hardship = PENALTY applies ❌
      - Example: Age 55, QUIT job, take distribution = NO penalty ✓
      - **Memory**: "Rule of 55: You must QUIT (separate), not just hit 55"
      - **Memory**: "In-Service = In-Penalty" (if under 59½ and not disabled)
    - **Rule of 55**: Age 55+ separation from employer (401(k) only, NOT IRAs)
      - Age 50 for public safety employees (police, firefighters)
      - Must separate from service at/after age 55
      - Only applies to that specific employer's plan
    - **QDRO (Qualified Domestic Relations Order)**:
      - Alternate payee can take cash penalty-free at ANY age
      - Can also roll to own IRA tax-free
      - Only recipient gets penalty exception, not participant
    - **IRA vs 401(k) Exception Differences**:
      - Both: Death, disability, medical >7.5% AGI, SEPP/72(t)
      - IRA ONLY: Education, first home ($10K), health insurance (unemployed), IRS levy
      - 401(k) ONLY: Rule of 55 (age 55+ separation)
    - **"HIDES" mnemonic for IRA exceptions**:
      - H = Higher education (qualified expenses)
      - I = Insurance (health premiums if unemployed 12+ weeks)
      - D = Disability
      - E = Excessive medical (>7.5% AGI)
      - S = SEPP (72(t) substantially equal payments)
    - Perfect on practice problems (Rule of 55, QDRO, IRA education exception) ✓
  - **401(k) Hardship Withdrawals vs In-Service Rollovers** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **Hardship Withdrawal Requirements**:
      - Must prove immediate and heavy financial need
      - Common reasons: Medical expenses, home purchase, tuition, prevent foreclosure/eviction, funeral
      - Tax treatment: Ordinary income + 10% penalty (if under 59½)
      - **Cannot be repaid** to plan (unlike loans)
      - **Suspension**: No contributions for 6 months after hardship withdrawal
    - **Why Hardship Withdrawal Exists** (vs regular withdrawal):
      - Many 401(k) plans DON'T allow regular in-service withdrawals before age 59½
      - Hardship provision provides emergency access when truly needed
      - "Better than nothing" when no other option exists
    - **Student's Excellent Alternative Question**: "Why not rollover to IRA first, then withdraw?"
      - **CRITICAL RESTRICTION**: In-service rollovers generally NOT allowed before age 59½
      - Can't rollover WHILE still employed at that company (except specific circumstances)
      - **Exception**: Some plans allow in-service rollovers after age 59½
      - **Result**: For Joe (age 48), rollover NOT an option → Hardship withdrawal is only choice
    - **Why This Is Important**:
      - Student demonstrated EXCELLENT professional skepticism ✓
      - Identified potential alternative solution (rollover strategy)
      - Understanding restriction helps explain why hardship rules exist
      - Real-world CFP advice: Build emergency fund to AVOID needing hardship withdrawals!
    - **Tax Comparison**:
      - Hardship withdrawal: Taxed + 10% penalty (expensive!)
      - Regular withdrawal (if allowed): Taxed + 10% penalty (same cost)
      - **Key insight**: Hardship requirements don't make it MORE expensive, just regulate ACCESS
    - **Joe's Mortgage Problem** (2025-11-01):
      - Age 48, $60K mortgage due, no cash, has 401(k)
      - Can't do regular withdrawal (plan doesn't allow in-service before 59½)
      - Can't rollover to IRA (in-service rollover restricted before 59½)
      - **ONLY option**: Hardship withdrawal (prevents foreclosure = qualifies)
      - Takes withdrawal, pays tax + 10% penalty, keeps house ✓
    - Student challenged instructor twice with excellent questions - shows deep thinking! ✓

- [x] **F.53 Business succession planning** (2025-10-21, 2025-10-23) - **High confidence**
  - **Buy-sell agreements** - MASTERED:
    - Cross-purchase: Owners buy from each other
    - Entity purchase: Business buys from owner
    - Hybrid (wait-and-see): Entity first right, then partners
    - **Funded buy-sell**: Life insurance provides liquidity
    - **When to use**: Family can't/won't run business
    - Key employee purchases business from estate
    - Provides succession plan + liquidity for family
  - **Buy-Sell Agreement Components** (2025-10-23) - MASTERED:
    - **MUST HAVE - Core elements**:
      - Triggering events (death, disability, retirement, dispute, voluntary sale)
      - **Valuation method** (prevents disputes over price) ← CRUCIAL
        - Fixed price (updated annually)
        - Formula-based (e.g., 5x EBITDA, book value multiple)
        - Independent appraisal
        - Combination approach
      - Funding mechanism (life insurance, sinking fund, installments)
      - Purchase obligation (must buy vs may buy)
      - First right of refusal provisions
      - Transfer restrictions
    - **SHOULD HAVE - Family protection**:
      - **Trust establishment** (manages transaction, protects family) ← CRUCIAL
        - Trust owns shares or receives insurance proceeds
        - Professional trustee handles buyout
        - Removes emotion from transaction
        - Clear distribution plan for family
    - **NOT IN BUY-SELL AGREEMENT** (common trap):
      - ❌ Roles and responsibilities (goes in operating agreement)
      - ❌ Job descriptions (employment contracts)
      - ❌ Management succession plan (separate document)
      - ❌ CEO transition timeline (succession roadmap)
      - **Key distinction**: Buy-sell = OWNERSHIP transfer, NOT management structure
    - **AVOID**:
      - ❌ Asset exclusions (creates ambiguity and future disputes)
      - Keep agreement comprehensive and clear
    - Perfect on practice problem (valuation + trust, not roles) ✓
  - **Business structures for succession**:
    - When family involved: FLP, voting/non-voting stock, GRAT
    - When family NOT involved: Buy-sell to key employee or third party
  - ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans)
  - Disability buy-out insurance
  - **Practical application**: Match tools to client situation (family capability/willingness)

      - Employer's creditors CAN reach funds (risky for employee)
      - Employer CANNOT take money back (irrevocable)
      - Tax-deferred until distribution
      - Springing irrevocability: Becomes irrevocable upon trigger event (e.g., management takeover)
    - **Secular Trust**:
      - Employer's creditors CANNOT reach funds (protected)
      - Immediately taxable to employee (no tax deferral)
      - Trade-off: Protection vs tax timing

### ✅ Mastered Topics (9/14)

- [x] **G.54 Property titling** (2025-10-11, 2025-10-19, 2025-11-02) - **High confidence**
  - Probate vs non-probate assets
  - JTWROS (avoids probate)
  - Tenants in common (goes through probate)
  - Life insurance beneficiary strategies (to person vs to estate)
  - **JTWROS vs Tenancy in Common** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **#1 Rule of JTWROS**: CANNOT pass by will (bypasses will entirely!)
      - Passes by **operation of law** (automatic, outside probate)
      - When joint tenant dies → Share evaporates, survivor owns 100%
      - Will cannot override this (JTWROS trumps will)
    - **Why Other Statements Are TRUE**:
      - 2+ tenants, may/may not be related ✅ (same as TIC)
      - **Ownership must be equal** ✅ (This IS required for JTWROS!)
      - Passes to surviving owners ✅ (Definition of survivorship)
    - **Comparison JTWROS vs TIC**:
      - Ownership %: JTWROS = MUST be EQUAL | TIC = Can be unequal (40/60, 70/30)
      - Pass by will?: JTWROS = NO (bypasses will!) | TIC = YES (will controls)
      - Survivorship?: JTWROS = YES (survivor takes all) | TIC = NO (heirs get %)
      - Probate?: JTWROS = NO (outside probate) | TIC = YES (goes through probate)
    - **The 4 Unities of JTWROS (TIPS)**:
      - **T**ime: All owners get title at same time
      - **I**nterest: All owners have same interest (equal % - REQUIRED!)
      - **P**ossession: All owners have equal right to possess
      - **S**urvivorship: Right of survivorship
    - **Memory System**:
      - "JTWROS = 3 Magic Words: EQUAL, AUTOMATIC, WILL-PROOF"
      - "Your Will is Powerless Against JTWROS"
      - "Equal Shares, Survivor Cares, Will Don't Matter"
    - Student thought "ownership must be equal" was wrong answer ✓
    - Now understands: JTWROS CANNOT pass by will (that's the false statement) ✓
  - **Ancillary Probate** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **The Problem**: Out-of-state real property creates **TWO probate proceedings**
      - **Primary probate**: State where decedent lived (domicile)
      - **Ancillary probate**: State where real property is located
      - **Result**: Double costs, double time (2-3 years vs 1 year), double complexity
    - **Why It's a Nightmare**:
      - Pay for probate in BOTH states (2× attorney fees, court fees)
      - Different state laws, different courts, coordination required
      - Delays transfer significantly (defeats "expedite transfer" goal)
    - **Solution - Lifetime Transfer**:
      - Transfer property BEFORE death to avoid ancillary probate
      - Options: Gift to beneficiaries, Revocable Living Trust, JTWROS, LLC
      - **Result**: No ancillary probate, faster transfer, lower costs
    - **Dave & Jessica Example** (2025-11-02):
      - Beachfront cottage **in another state** (red flag!)
      - Goal: "Expedite transfer of estate assets"
      - **Recommendation**: Lifetime transfer of cottage
      - Why: Avoids ancillary probate entirely, achieves expedite goal
    - **Memory System**:
      - "OUT-OF-STATE = OUT-OF-LUCK (without planning)"
      - "ANCILLARY = ANOTHER STATE = ANOTHER PROBATE"
      - "The THREE A's": ANCILLARY probate → Lifetime transfer
    - Student initially didn't select lifetime transfer recommendation ✓
    - Now understands: Out-of-state property = ancillary probate problem ✓
  - **JTWROS Estate Tax Treatment** (2025-10-19) - MASTERED:
    - Included in gross estate for estate tax (IRC § 2040) ✓
    - 50% included for spouses, 100% for non-spouses (unless prove contribution)
    - Avoids PROBATE but NOT estate tax ✓
    - Common trap: "avoids probate" ≠ "avoids estate tax"
  - **Step-Up Basis Rules**:
    - JTWROS: 50% step-up (spouses in common law states)
    - Community Property: 100% step-up (both halves)
    - TIC: Only deceased's % gets step-up
  - **Memory System Created**: "3 P's Test" (Probate, Pass, Percentage)
  - **In slides**: Pages 20-40

- [x] **G.55 Strategies to transfer property** (2025-10-21, 2025-10-31) - **High confidence**
  - **Self-Canceling Installment Note (SCIN)** - MASTERED:
    - Seller sells property to buyer for installment note
    - If seller dies before note paid off, remaining payments CANCELLED
    - **Perfect for shortened life expectancy**: High probability of dying during term
    - Provides cash flow during life + estate tax savings
    - SCIN premium (slightly higher price) compensates for cancellation risk
    - **Textbook use case**: Person with health issues/shortened life expectancy
  - **SCIN vs Other Gift Tax Avoidance Methods** (2025-10-31) - MASTERED:
    - **SCIN with premium over FMV** = Treated as **SALE** (not gift)
      - Buyer pays FMV + premium
      - Premium compensates for cancellation risk
      - IRS treats as legitimate business transaction
      - **Result**: NO GIFT TAX (even if applicable credit exhausted)
    - **All other common methods create GIFTS**:
      - **QPRT**: Transfer to trust = taxable gift of remainder interest
      - **FLP with gifts**: Only $18K annual exclusion applies, excess is taxable gift
        - Example: $50K gift - $18K exclusion = $32K taxable gift
        - With exhausted credit → immediate gift tax liability
      - **JTWROS**: Adding joint tenant = gift of 50% ownership
    - **Key distinction**: SCIN is ONLY method that's a SALE instead of GIFT
    - **Memory aid**: "SCIN = SALE" vs "Everything else = GIFT", "SCIN keeps it CLEAN"
  - **Private annuity contracts**:
    - Transfer property for lifetime payments
    - Unsecured obligation
    - With shortened life expectancy: Actuarially valued higher (bad for buyer)
  - **When to use SCIN vs Private Annuity**:
    - SCIN: Shortened life expectancy (seller likely dies during term)
    - Private Annuity: Normal life expectancy, need lifetime income
  - **GRIT limitations**: Doesn't work for family members (IRC §2702)
  - **In slides**: Pages 70-85
  - **Note**: Compared to FLP (long time horizon) and GRIT (non-family only)

- [x] **G.57 Gift, estate, and GST tax compliance and calculation** (2025-10-21, 2025-11-01, 2025-11-02) - **High confidence**
  - **Overqualification and Portability** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **Student's EXCELLENT Question**: "But there's credit portability right?"
    - **Answer**: YES, portability exists BUT has major limitations!
    - **Portability (DSUE - Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion)**:
      - Surviving spouse can "inherit" deceased spouse's unused exemption
      - Must file Form 706 within 9 months (even if no tax due!)
      - Example: Husband dies with $5M unused → Wife gets $5M DSUE
    - **BUT Portability Has 3 MAJOR Limitations**:
      1. **NO GROWTH PROTECTION** (BIGGEST PROBLEM!):
         - Credit Shelter Trust: Growth protected (tax-free forever)
         - Portability: Growth NOT protected (taxable in surviving spouse's estate)
         - Example: $13.61M grows to $30M
           - Portability: $30M in wife's estate, excess over $27.22M taxed at 40%
           - Credit Shelter Trust: $30M NOT in wife's estate, goes to kids tax-free
           - **Tax savings**: Over $1M with Credit Shelter Trust!
      2. **Remarriage Problem**: Can only use LAST deceased spouse's DSUE (lose first spouse's!)
      3. **Must File Form 706**: Not automatic, miss deadline = lose portability forever
    - **Modern Definition of Overqualification**:
      - **Pre-portability**: Wasting exemption amount itself
      - **Post-portability**: Wasting **growth protection** benefit
      - Either way = **underutilization of credit's value**
    - **Statement I TRUE**: Overqualification = underutilization of applicable credit
      - Even with portability, growth protection underutilized
      - Not all estates file Form 706 (portability lost)
      - Remarriage can eliminate DSUE
    - **Statement II FALSE**: Describes UNDERQUALIFICATION (backwards!)
      - Overqualification = TOO MUCH to spouse (over-used marital deduction)
      - Underqualification = TOO LITTLE to spouse (under-used marital deduction)
    - **Memory System**:
      - "OVER to spouse = UNDER-used exemption"
      - "Portability transfers DOLLARS, Trust protects GROWTH"
      - "Portability = Portable Exemption, NOT Portable Growth Protection"
    - Student challenged overqualification concept with portability question ✓
    - Now understands: Portability doesn't protect growth, overqualification still wastes benefit ✓
  - **Annual Exclusion Gifting** - MASTERED:
    - Per donor, per donee, per year
    - 2023: $17,000, 2024: $18,000, 2025: $19,000 (projected)
    - Married couples: Each spouse can give separately
    - Can give to children AND their spouses (separate donees)
    - Example: 2 parents × 4 recipients × $17K = $136K annual gifts
    - "Without using applicable exclusion" = stay within annual limits
  - **Gift Valuation and Tax Calculation** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **Gifts ALWAYS valued at FMV** (not donor's basis!)
    - Taxable gift = FMV - Annual exclusion ($18K)
    - Lifetime exclusion 2024: $13,610,000
    - Applicable credit offsets tax on gifts below lifetime exclusion
    - Example: $5,130,000 gift - $18K = $5,112,000 taxable → no tax due (covered by credit)
  - **Loss Property Gifts and Double-Basis Rule** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **Loss property**: FMV < Donor's basis (property went down in value)
    - **Gift tax can ONLY be added to basis for APPRECIATED property**
      - Appreciated (FMV > Basis): Gift tax CAN be allocated to increase basis ✓
      - Loss property (FMV < Basis): Gift tax CANNOT be allocated ❌
    - **Double-Basis Rule for Loss Property**:
      - Donee receives TWO different bases:
        - **Gain basis**: Donor's original basis (for calculating gains)
        - **Loss basis**: FMV at time of gift (for calculating losses)
      - **Sale scenarios**:
        - Sell above donor's basis → Use gain basis (donor's original basis)
        - Sell below FMV at gift → Use loss basis (FMV at gift)
        - **Sell between the two bases → NO gain or loss** (the "dead zone")
    - **Example**: Basis $6.8M, FMV $5.13M at gift
      - Sell for $7M → Gain = $200K (use $6.8M basis)
      - Sell for $6.5M → NO gain or loss (in dead zone)
      - Sell for $5M → Loss = $130K (use $5.13M basis)
    - **Memory Aid**: "FAB-L" (FMV for gift tax, Appreciated only for basis addition, Bases are double, Loss property has dead zone)
  - **Gross Estate Calculation** - MASTERED:
    - **3-Year Lookback Rule (IRC §2035)**:
      - Life insurance transferred within 3 years of death → included in estate
      - Prevents deathbed transfers to avoid estate tax
      - Must transfer >3 years before death for ILIT to work
      - If transfer <3 years: Death benefit included in gross estate
    - **JTWROS Estate Tax Treatment (IRC §2040)**:
      - Spouses: 50% included in deceased's gross estate
      - Non-spouses: 100% unless prove contribution
      - Avoids probate but NOT estate tax
    - **Formula**: Add up all includible assets
  - **Lifetime Exclusion**: $13.61M (2024), adjusts for inflation
  - **In slides**: Pages 50-120 (most comprehensive estate section)
  - **Key distinction**: Annual exclusion vs lifetime exemption

- [x] **G.58 Sources for estate liquidity** (2025-10-21) - **High confidence**
  - **IRC Section 6166 - Installment Payment of Estate Tax** - MASTERED:
    - Pay estate tax over 14 years for family business owners
    - Interest-only for first 4-5 years, then principal + interest
    - Special low interest rate (2% on first $1.7M)
    - Requirements: Closely-held business >35% of adjusted gross estate
    - **Perfect for**: Family business owners with illiquid estates
    - Prevents forced sale of business to pay estate taxes
  - **Immediate Liquidity Sources**:
    - Life insurance death benefit (if estate is beneficiary)
    - Cash and checking accounts
    - Stocks and bonds (sell within days/weeks)
    - Money market accounts
  - **NOT Immediate Liquidity**:
    - Borrowing (complex, slow, creates new debt)
    - Rental income (ongoing, not lump sum)
  - **NOT Estate Liquidity**:
    - Retirement accounts with beneficiaries (bypass estate)
    - Life insurance with beneficiaries (bypass estate)
  - **Critical Distinction**: Estate assets vs. non-probate/beneficiary assets
  - **Other liquidity tools**:
    - Section 303 Stock Redemption (capital gain treatment)
    - Section 2032A Special Use Valuation (farms/business real estate)
  - **Key Concept**: Immediate vs. medium-term vs. ongoing liquidity sources
  - **In slides**: Pages 150-165

- [x] **G.59 Types, features, and taxation of trusts** (2025-10-20 voice, 2025-10-21, 2025-11-01) - **High confidence**
  - **Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRT)**:
    - CRAT (Annuity): Fixed dollar amount annually, remainder to charity
    - CRUT (Unitrust): Percentage of value (varies), remainder to charity
    - Income to donor/beneficiaries during life, remainder to CHARITY
  - **Grantor Retained Trusts (GRT)**:
    - GRAT (Annuity): Fixed payment to grantor, remainder to FAMILY
    - GRUT (Unitrust): Percentage payment to grantor, remainder to FAMILY
    - Key difference from CRT: Remainder goes to beneficiaries, not charity
  - **QPRT (Qualified Personal Residence Trust)** (2025-10-21) - MASTERED:
    - Transfer residence to trust, retain right to live there for X years
    - After term, residence passes to beneficiaries
    - Gift = FMV of home - PV of retained interest
    - **Maximum of TWO QPRTs** (principal residence + one other)
    - **AFR effect**: Higher AFR → Lower PV of retained interest
    - **Term length effect**: Shorter term → Higher gift (less retained interest)
    - **Planning tradeoff**: Shorter term (safer, higher gift) vs Longer term (riskier, lower gift)
    - Must survive term or property comes back into estate
    - Gift occurs at CREATION, not termination
  - **Charitable Lead Trust (CLT)**:
    - Opposite of CRT: Income to CHARITY first, remainder to FAMILY later
  - **Pooled Income Fund**:
    - Simpler charitable giving vehicle, managed by charity
    - Income to donor, remainder to charity
  - **QTIP (Qualified Terminable Interest Property Trust)**:
    - Marital deduction trust for surviving spouse
    - Spouse gets income for life, grantor controls remainder (often kids from first marriage)
    - Estate tax deferred until second spouse dies
  - **QDOT (Qualified Domestic Trust)**:
    - For non-citizen spouse to preserve marital deduction
    - US trustee requirement
    - Estate tax deferred until distributions or death
  - **ABC Trust Structure**:
    - A Trust (Bypass/Applicable Exclusion): Uses deceased's estate tax exemption
    - C Trust (Marital/QTIP): Surviving spouse's assets, gets marital deduction
    - Less common now due to portability of estate tax exemption
  - **ILIT (Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust)**:
    - Transfer life insurance to remove from estate
    - **3-year rule applies**: Must transfer >3 years before death
    - If <3 years: Death benefit included in gross estate anyway
  - **Key Framework**: "Who gets what" - income recipient vs remainder recipient
  - **Memory Aid Created**: CRAT/CRUT → Charity Remainder, GRAT/GRUT → Grantor Retained
  - **CRT 4-Tier Taxation** (2025-10-21) - MASTERED:
    - **Not** a basis calculation like annuities!
    - **Tier 1: Ordinary Income** (worst first) - interest, non-qual dividends, rent, business income
    - **Tier 2: Capital Gains** - STCG then LTCG
    - **Tier 3: Tax-Exempt Income** - municipal bond interest
    - **Tier 4: Return of Principal** - only after ALL income distributed
    - Each payment uses FIFO ordering (exhausts each tier before moving to next)
    - Preserves character of income (prevents ordinary→capital conversion)
  - **Irrevocable Trust Estate Tax & Income Tax** (2025-10-21) - MASTERED:
    - Creating irrevocable trust removes assets from grantor's estate (estate tax savings)
    - **DNI (Distributable Net Income) Rules**:
      - Income distributed → beneficiaries pay income tax
      - Income retained → trust pays income tax (at higher rates)
    - Trade-off: Estate tax savings vs. loss of step-up in basis
    - Property in irrevocable trust gets carryover basis, not step-up at death
  - **IRC §678 - Beneficiary as Owner for Tax Purposes** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **"Power = Ownership" Rule**: If beneficiary has power to withdraw trust assets but chooses not to → treated as owner for income tax
    - **Who pays tax on trust income**:
      - **Beneficiary pays**: When beneficiary has withdrawal power (whether exercised or not)
      - **Trust pays**: When beneficiary has NO withdrawal power (trustee discretion only)
      - **The power is the key**, not whether they actually take distributions
    - **Constructive ownership**: Your ability to control = your tax responsibility
  - **§2503(c) Trusts - Minor's Trust** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - Trust for minors that qualifies gifts for annual exclusion
    - Must give beneficiary access/withdrawal right at age 21 (or shortly after)
    - **Tax consequence when beneficiary doesn't revoke**:
      - Beneficiary has right to revoke at age 21-23 but chooses to let trust continue
      - Beneficiary pays tax on ALL trust income going forward (even though doesn't take distributions)
      - Why? Has power to withdraw → IRC §678 applies → treated as owner
    - **Example**: Julie gets revocation right at 23, doesn't revoke, lets trust continue to 30
      - Julie pays income tax on trust earnings from age 23-30
      - Even though money stays in trust and Julie doesn't receive distributions
  - **Crummey Powers - Gift Tax vs Income Tax Purposes** (2025-11-01) - MASTERED:
    - **Student's BRILLIANT insight**: "Why don't ILIT Crummey powers create income tax issue?"
    - **Answer**: Life insurance cash value growth = TAX-DEFERRED (IRC §7702)
    - **Key Distinction**:
      - **§2503(c) trust with stocks/bonds**: Generates dividends, interest, capital gains = LOTS of taxable income
        - Beneficiary with withdrawal power → pays tax on all that income
      - **ILIT with life insurance**: Cash value grows tax-deferred → minimal/zero taxable income
        - Only taxable income = tiny interest on cash in trust account ($50-$500/year)
        - Trust pays small tax; beneficiaries not affected
    - **Why use Crummey powers in ILIT**:
      - Purpose: GIFT TAX (qualify for annual exclusion)
      - NOT for income tax issue (no income to worry about!)
      - Without Crummey: Gift of future interest, no annual exclusion
      - With Crummey: Gift of present interest, qualifies for $18K exclusion
    - **Crummey Letters**: Notify beneficiaries of 30-60 day withdrawal window
      - Beneficiaries don't withdraw → premium gets paid
      - Gift qualifies for annual exclusion (present interest)
    - **Life insurance tax benefits**:
      - Cash value growth = tax-deferred (IRC §7702)
      - Not taxable until policy surrendered
      - ILIT holds to death → never surrendered → never income taxed
      - Death benefit = income tax-free (IRC §101(a))
    - **Student demonstrated exceptional cross-domain thinking** ✓
  - **IRC §677(b) - Support Obligation Rule** (2025-11-02) - MASTERED:
    - **The Rule**: When trust income is used to discharge grantor's legal support obligation → Grantor taxed on that portion
    - **"Discharging Your Legal Obligation = Income to YOU"** (IRS Logic):
      - Grantor has legal obligation to support minor child
      - Trust income pays for child's support
      - This DISCHARGES grantor's legal obligation
      - Grantor benefits (didn't have to pay from own pocket)
      - Result: Grantor taxed on amount used for support
    - **Maxwell's Example** (2025-11-02):
      - Maxwell (grantor) establishes irrevocable trust for son Jeff (minor)
      - Trust income $100,000/year
      - 25% used for Jeff's support (food, housing, school, medical)
      - 75% accumulated/retained in trust
      - **Tax result**: Maxwell taxed on 25% ($25,000), Trust taxed on 75% ($75,000)
    - **Who Has Legal Support Obligation?**:
      - ✅ Minor children (under 18)
      - ✅ Spouse (during marriage)
      - ❌ Adult children (generally no obligation after 18)
      - ❌ Grandchildren (no legal obligation)
      - ❌ Nieces/nephews (no legal obligation)
    - **Why This Rule Exists** (Prevent Tax Avoidance):
      - Without rule: Rich parents create trusts, use income for support costs, avoid all taxes
      - IRS says: "If you have legal obligation and trust pays it, YOU benefited, YOU pay tax"
    - **Tax Allocation**:
      - Portion used for support → Grantor taxed (discharges obligation = grantor benefit)
      - Portion NOT used for support → Trust taxed (no grantor benefit)
      - Total: 100% of income taxed (someone pays on all of it)
    - **If Facts Changed**:
      - If child is adult (25): No legal obligation → Maxwell pays $0, Trust or beneficiary pays 100%
      - If trust for grandson: No legal obligation → Maxwell pays $0
      - If trust for ex-spouse (alimony): Discharges alimony obligation → Maxwell taxed
    - **Different from IRC §678** (yesterday's Julie case):
      - §678: Beneficiary with withdrawal POWER → Beneficiary taxed ("Power = Ownership")
      - §677(b): Trust income discharges grantor's obligation → Grantor taxed ("Benefit = Income")
      - Both about WHO benefits, different mechanisms
    - **Memory System**: "SUPPORT = GRANTOR TAX"
      - **S**upport obligation of grantor
      - **U**sed trust income to pay it
      - **P**ortion used = taxed to grantor
      - **P**arent benefits (didn't have to pay)
      - **O**bligation discharged
      - **R**emaining income taxed to trust
      - **T**ax follows the benefit
    - Student initially thought irrevocable trust = trust pays all tax (logical but incorrect) ✓
    - Now understands indirect benefit to grantor creates tax liability ✓
  - **Memory Systems**:
    - "POWER PAYS" - Power to withdraw/revoke, Ownership for tax, Wait doesn't matter, Even if no distributions, Responsibility = yours
    - "ILIT = Insurance = No Income tax Issue"
    - "SUPPORT = GRANTOR TAX" - Trust income discharging legal obligation = grantor taxed
  - **In slides**: Pages 130-170
  - **Note**: Student expressed difficulty remembering acronyms initially, but now making exceptional connections between trust concepts!

- [x] **G.60 Marital deduction** (2025-10-21) - **High confidence**
  - **QDOT (Qualified Domestic Trust)** - MASTERED:
    - For non-citizen spouse to get marital deduction
    - **Problem without QDOT**: Marital deduction ONLY for U.S. citizen spouses
    - **Solution**: QDOT enables unlimited marital deduction for non-citizen spouse
    - **Estate tax deferred, not eliminated**:
      - No estate tax at first spouse's death (marital deduction applies)
      - Estate tax due on principal distributions to surviving spouse
      - Estate tax due at surviving spouse's death (on remaining assets)
    - **Income distributions**: NO estate tax (just income tax)
    - **Requirements**:
      - U.S. trustee (citizen or domestic corporation)
      - U.S. trustee can withhold estate tax on distributions
      - Irrevocable election on estate tax return
    - **Key distinction**: Non-citizen spouse does NOT become "domestic"
      - Still non-citizen, still gets different treatment than U.S. citizen spouse
      - QDOT is a workaround, not equivalence
  - **QTIP (Qualified Terminable Interest Property)**:
    - Marital deduction trust for surviving spouse
    - Spouse gets income for life
    - Grantor controls remainder (often kids from first marriage)
    - Estate tax deferred until second spouse dies
  - **Unlimited marital deduction**: No limit on gifts/bequests to U.S. citizen spouse
  - **Terminable interest rule**: Property that terminates doesn't qualify (unless QTIP)
  - **In slides**: Pages 50-70

- [x] **G.64 Special needs planning** (2025-10-21) - **High confidence**

    - Critical for disabled beneficiaries receiving inheritance
    - First-party vs third-party SNT

## Key Formulas to Memorize

### Investment Planning (D.31)
- **Capital Market Line (CML)**: **E(Rp) = Rf + [(E(RM) - Rf) / σM] × σp**
  - E(Rp) = Expected portfolio return
  - Rf = Risk-free rate
  - E(RM) = Expected market return
  - σM = Market standard deviation
  - σp = Portfolio standard deviation
- **CML Slope** (Market price of risk): **(E(RM) - Rf) / σM**

### Tax Planning (E.38, E.41)

**C Corporation Distribution Waterfall:**
1. Dividend income (up to E&P)
2. Return of basis (tax-free)
3. Capital gain (after basis exhausted)

**Depreciation Recapture:**
- **Section 1245** (Equipment): Ordinary income, all in Year 1
- **Section 1250** (Buildings, straight-line): Capital gain at 25%, can defer with installment

**Installment Sale:**
- **Gross Profit %** = **(Sale Price - Adjusted Basis) ÷ Contract Price**
- **Gain per payment** = Payment × Gross Profit %

### Estate & Gift Tax (NOT on formula sheet)
- First $1 million tax = **$345,800**
- Over $1 million = **40%**
