## Practice Problems

### Question 1: Medicare Part A Hospital Cost Calculation

**Problem Given**: Martha (age 68) hospitalized for 85 days. Already paid Part A deductible ($1,632) on day 1. How much will Martha pay out-of-pocket?

**Student's Initial Response**:
- Remembered there are different periods with different costs ✓
- Initially thought: "First 30 days deductible, 30-90 days coinsurance" ✗
- Remembered coinsurance was "$48 or something" (was reaching for $408)

**Correction Provided**:
- Days 1-60: Deductible only ($1,632) - Medicare covers rest
- Days 61-90: $408/day coinsurance
- Days 91-150: Lifetime reserve ($816/day)

**Student's Final Answer After Clarification**:
- Days 61-85 = **25 days** ✓ CORRECT
- 25 days × $408 = **$10,200** ✓ CORRECT
- Calculation executed perfectly

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Once given the correct day ranges and rates, calculated accurately and quickly. Shows improvement from yesterday's session where didn't calculate the total.

**Key Learning**: Medicare Part A hospital benefit periods: 1-60 (deductible only), 61-90 ($408/day), 91-150 (lifetime reserve $816/day).

### Question 2: Social Security Early Filing and Earnings Test

**Problem Given**: Carlos (age 64) starts SS early. FRA is 67, FRA benefit would be $2,400/month. Earns $35,000/year part-time.
- Part A: Monthly SS benefit amount?
- Part B: Earnings test penalty?

**Student's Answer**:

**Part A - Early Filing Reduction**:
- "Each year earlier is like 5% less or something, so 3 years is 15% less"
- Calculation shown: 15% reduction

**Evaluation**:
- ✓ Understood concept of early filing reduction
- ✓ Correctly identified 3 years early (age 64 vs FRA 67)
- ✗ Percentage slightly off: actual is ~6.67% per year = ~20% total for 3 years
- Student's answer: $2,400 × 0.85 = $2,040/month
- Correct answer: $2,400 × 0.80 = $1,920/month
- Close! Concept solid, just percentage needs refinement

**Part B - Earnings Test**:
- "Yes penalty, it has around 13000 more dollars that gives to 6500 penalties reduced per year"
- Calculation: ($35,000 - $22,320) = ~$13,000 over; ÷ 2 = ~$6,500 penalty

**Evaluation**:
- ✓ PERFECT understanding of earnings test
- ✓ Correctly identified applies before FRA
- ✓ Correctly calculated excess over threshold: $35,000 - $22,320 = $12,680 (said "around 13000")
- ✓ Correctly applied $1 for every $2 formula: $12,680 ÷ 2 = $6,340 (said "6500")
- Excellent approximation and understanding!

**Correct Answers**:
- Part A: $1,920/month (20% reduction)
- Part B: Loses $6,340/year in SS benefits

**Understanding Level**: VERY GOOD
- Part A: Solid conceptual understanding, needs to remember ~6-7% per year (not 5%)
- Part B: Excellent - nailed the earnings test calculation

**Key Learning**: Early filing reduces benefits by ~6-7% per year (not 5%), but earnings test calculation mastered perfectly.

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

| Topic | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Social Security Early Filing Reduction Rate | Low | Knows concept, just needs to refine: ~6-7% per year, not 5% |
| Medicare Part A Benefit Periods | Low → IMPROVING | Initially confused day ranges (30 vs 60), but corrected quickly and calculated perfectly |

---

## Topics Demonstrated Today

| Topic | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Medicare Part A Cost Calculations | High | Perfect execution once day ranges clarified: 25 days × $408 = $10,200 ✓ |
| Social Security Earnings Test | High | Nailed the calculation: ~$13k over ÷ 2 = ~$6,500 penalty ✓ |
| Social Security Early Filing Concept | Medium-High | Understands reduction principle, just needs exact percentage (6-7%, not 5%) |

---

## Session Progress

**Strengths Observed**:
- Quick mental math (25 × $408, $35k - $22k ÷ 2)
- Strong conceptual understanding even when exact numbers slightly off
- Improving on Medicare calculations from yesterday
- Excellent retention of earnings test rules

**Areas for Continued Practice**:
- Exact percentages for Social Security reductions
- Medicare Part A day ranges (1-60, 61-90, 91-150)

---

## Action Items for Next Session

**Review:**
- [ ] Social Security reduction rates: ~6-7% per year for early filing before FRA
- [ ] Medicare Part A benefit period day ranges (commit to memory)

**Continue Practice:**
- [ ] More Social Security scenarios (spousal benefits, delayed filing)
- [ ] Medicare Part B cost-sharing
- [ ] Combined Medicare/Social Security problems

## Summary Statistics

**Session Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Questions Tested**: 2 practice problems
**Performance**: Strong - demonstrated solid understanding with minor refinements needed
**Improvement Noted**: Medicare calculations significantly better than yesterday

## Notes

Session 4 - Student is 21 days from exam. Quick practice session to test retention and application. Showed strong improvement on Medicare cost calculations from yesterday. Earnings test calculation was excellent. Early filing percentage needs minor refinement but concept is solid. Student has good instinct for approximation and mental math. Ready for more complex problems or new topics.
