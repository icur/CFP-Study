## Session Context

**Student Request**: Asked for comparison tables and rule clarification on penalty exceptions and withholding rules

**Session Focus**: Deep dive into IRA vs 401(k) differences across multiple rule sets

---

## Topics Covered

### Topic 1: IRA Distribution Penalty Exceptions - Age 55 Rule Trap

**Question**: Which IRA distribution penalty exceptions are correct?

**Student's Initial Answer**: Selected D (statements 1 and 2) - **INCORRECT** ❌

**Correct Answer**: A (statements 2 and 3)

**Initial Understanding**:
- Thought age 55 separation from service applied to IRAs
- Didn't know this exception is ONLY for qualified plans (401k), NOT IRAs

**Explanation Given**:

**Statement 1: "Age 55 separation from service" ❌ FALSE for IRAs**

**The Rule**: Age 55 exception = **401(k)/Qualified Plans ONLY!**

**Why**:
- Separate from employer at 55+ → Can take 401(k) penalty-free ✅
- Separate from employer at 55+ → IRA still needs age 59½ ❌

**Critical Trap**:
- Age 55, retire, take from 401(k) → No penalty ✅
- Age 55, retire, **roll to IRA**, take distribution → **PENALTY!** (not 59½ yet) ❌

**Memory System**: "Age **55** Rule = **401(5) K**eep at work ONLY"

**Key Learning**:
- Age 55 separation exception ONLY applies to qualified plans (401k, 403b, pension)
- Does NOT apply to IRAs - must be 59½ for IRA
- Rolling 401(k) to IRA loses the age 55 exception
- Common CFP exam trap!

---

### Topic 2: Complete IRA vs 401(k) Penalty Exception Comparison

**Student Request**: "among all the exceptions, help me to create a comparison between 401k and IRAs what's the same and different exceptions"

**Research Conducted**: Searched IRS.gov and authoritative sources to verify all exceptions

**Complete Table Created** (17 total exceptions):

**BOTH IRA and 401(k)** (11 exceptions):
1. Age 59½
2. Death (beneficiary)
3. Disability
4. Medical expenses >7.5% AGI
5. IRS levy
6. SEPP (72(t))
7. Birth/Adoption ($5K)
8. Reservist called to duty (180+ days)
9. Qualified disasters
10. Domestic abuse ($10K) - NEW 2024
11. Emergency expense ($1K/year) - NEW 2024

**401(k) ONLY** (3 exceptions):
1. **Age 55 separation from job** 🔑
2. **QDRO (divorce)** 🔑
3. Public safety age 50 (federal only)

**IRA ONLY** (3 exceptions):
1. **First home ($10K lifetime)** 🔑
2. **Education costs** 🔑
3. **Health insurance (unemployed)** 🔑

**Memory System**:
- "401(k) = **J**ob-Related Exceptions" (Age 55 job separation, QDRO from employer plan, Public safety job)
- "IRA = Personal Life Exceptions (**HEH**)" (Home, Education, Health insurance)

**Key Traps Identified**:
- **Trap 1**: Age 55 + Rollover → Lose exception if roll to IRA
- **Trap 2**: QDRO + Rollover → Lose exception if ex-spouse rolls to IRA before withdrawing
- **Trap 3**: Education → Only IRA, not 401(k)
- **Trap 4**: First Home → Only IRA, not 401(k)

**Sources**: IRS.gov, Lord Abbett, Kiplinger, Schwab - all verified

### Topic 3: Life Insurance in Retirement Plans

**Question**: Which statement about SIMPLE IRAs is CORRECT?
- Statement I: Business cannot have >100 employees earning $5,000+
- Statement II: SIMPLE IRA assets can invest in life insurance

**Student's Answer**: D (Both I and II) - **INCORRECT** ❌

**Correct Answer**: B (I only)

**Initial Understanding**:
- Thought SIMPLE IRAs could invest in life insurance
- Didn't know that SIMPLE IRAs are IRAs (subject to IRC §408 prohibition)

**Research Conducted**: Searched IRS rules on life insurance in retirement plans

**Complete List Created**:

**✅ CAN Invest in Life Insurance** (with limits):
- 401(k) → 25-50 rule
- Profit-Sharing → 25-50 rule
- Money Purchase Pension → 25-50 rule
- Defined Benefit Pension → 100x rule
- Solo 401(k) → 25-50 rule
- Cash Balance Plan → 100x rule

**❌ CANNOT Invest in Life Insurance**:
- Traditional IRA → IRC §408(a)(3) prohibits
- Roth IRA → IRC §408(e)(5)(B) prohibits
- **SEP IRA** → It's an IRA 🔑
- **SIMPLE IRA** → It's an IRA 🔑
- Rollover IRA → It's an IRA

**The 25-50-100 Rule (Incidental Benefit Rules)**:
- **Term/Universal Life**: Premiums ≤ 25% of contributions
- **Whole Life**: Premiums ≤ 50% of contributions
- **DB Pension**: Death benefit ≤ 100 × monthly pension

**Memory System**:
- "IRA = **I**nsurance **R**estricted **A**lways" 🔑
- "Qualified Plans = **Q**ualify for life insurance" ✅
- **If plan name has "IRA" in it → NO life insurance!**

**Key Rule**:
- IRC §408 (IRA rules): Life insurance PROHIBITED
- IRC §401 (Qualified plan rules): Life insurance ALLOWED (with 25-50-100 limits)

**Exam Trap**: "Can SEP or SIMPLE invest in life insurance?"
- ❌ WRONG: "SEP and SIMPLE are employer plans, so YES"
- ✅ CORRECT: "SEP and SIMPLE use **IRA accounts**, so NO!"

**Key Learning**:
- SEP and SIMPLE are IRAs, cannot invest in life insurance
- All qualified plans (401k, profit-sharing, pension) CAN invest in life insurance with limits
- Key distinction: IRA in name = NO life insurance

---

### Topic 4: 20% Withholding Rule - Qualified Plans vs IRAs

**Question**: Which distributions are subject to 20% withholding rule?
- A) Partial distribution from qualified plan to participant
- B) Trustee-to-trustee transfer of DC plan to IRA
- C) IRA distribution with intention to rollover within 60 days
- D) IRA distribution with NO intention to rollover

**Student's Answer**: D - **INCORRECT** ❌

**Correct Answer**: A

**Initial Understanding**:
- Thought IRA distributions (when cashing out completely) subject to 20% withholding
- Didn't know 20% mandatory withholding ONLY applies to qualified plans

**Research Conducted**: Searched IRS.gov and 26 CFR §31.3405 for withholding rules

**The Rule**:

**✅ SUBJECT to 20% Mandatory Withholding**:
- Qualified plan (401k, 403b, pension) → paid to participant directly
- Cannot elect out
- MANDATORY

**❌ NOT SUBJECT to 20% Mandatory Withholding**:
- **IRA → Any distribution** (only 10% VOLUNTARY withholding) 🔑
- Direct rollover (trustee-to-trustee) → No withholding
- RMDs from any plan → Not eligible rollover distribution

**Key Distinction**:
- **Qualified Plans** (401k, 403b, pension): 20% MANDATORY (can't opt out)
- **IRAs** (all types): 10% DEFAULT, can elect 0% to 100% (VOLUNTARY)

**Complete Table**:

| Source | To | 20% Withholding? |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| 401(k) | Participant | ✅ YES (mandatory) |
| 401(k) | Direct rollover | ❌ NO |
| IRA | Participant (cash out) | ❌ NO (10% voluntary) |
| IRA | 60-day rollover | ❌ NO (10% voluntary) |
| IRA | Trustee-to-trustee | ❌ NO |

**Memory System**:
- "20% = Qualified plan paid to **YOU**" 🔑
- "IRA = I Request Amount (voluntary withholding)" 🔑

**The Trap**:
- Students think: "Cashing out completely = 20% withholding"
- Truth: Only TRUE for qualified plans, FALSE for IRAs

**Why D is Wrong**:
- Option D is IRA distribution (no intention to reinvest)
- IRAs are NEVER subject to 20% mandatory withholding
- IRAs have 10% voluntary withholding (can elect 0%)

**Why A is Correct**:
- Qualified plan (401k at Widgets, Inc.)
- Paid directly to participant (not direct rollover)
- Result: 20% mandatory withholding applies

**Sources**: IRS.gov, 26 CFR §31.3405(c)-1, Mat Sorensen CPA

**Key Learning**:
- 20% mandatory withholding = Qualified plan + Direct to participant
- IRAs NEVER subject to 20% mandatory rule (only 10% voluntary)
- Direct rollovers exempt from withholding
- Whether you intend to rollover doesn't matter for IRA withholding

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

| Topic | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| IRA vs 401(k) Penalty Exceptions | High | Thought age 55 separation applied to IRAs. Now understands: Age 55 rule ONLY for 401(k), NOT IRAs. Must be 59½ for IRA. Rolling 401(k) to IRA loses age 55 exception. |
| QDRO Exception Scope | Medium | Didn't know QDRO exception only for qualified plans. Now understands: QDRO exception lost if rolled to IRA before distribution. |
| Life Insurance in SEP/SIMPLE | High | Thought SEP/SIMPLE could invest in life insurance. Now understands: SEP and SIMPLE are IRAs, subject to IRC §408 prohibition. Only qualified plans can hold life insurance. |
| 20% Withholding Rule | High | Thought IRAs subject to 20% mandatory withholding when cashing out. Now understands: 20% rule ONLY for qualified plans. IRAs have 10% VOLUNTARY withholding (can elect 0%). |

## Final Review Session - Retention Testing (Part 2)

**Tested 7 More Issues** - Student scored **6/7 (86%)**

### Issues Tested and Results:

14. ✅ **Hardship Withdrawals - 10% Penalty** → CORRECT: Allows access but doesn't avoid penalty. "Just gives you right to withdraw because normally you cannot withdraw from 401k"
15. ✅ **Municipal Bond Capital Gains** → CORRECT: Interest tax-free (federal exempt, state exempt if local), Capital gains fully taxable (federal + state)
16. ⚠️ **UGMA/UTMA vs Trust** → PARTIALLY CORRECT:
    - ✅ Custodial account (not trust) ✓
    - ✅ Reports on child's return ✓
    - ✅ Kiddie tax applies ✓
    - ❌ **Numbers WRONG**: Said $13,000 thresholds, actual is $1,300/$1,300/$2,600
    - **CRITICAL ERROR**: Off by 10x! Must memorize: **$1,300 free, $1,300 child rate, over $2,600 parent rate**
17. ⚠️ **AMT Property Tax Prepayment** → Initially wrong ("helps AMT"), then corrected after explanation
    - Learned: Property taxes added back in AMT, prepaying = no benefit, HURTS cash flow
    - Understood SALT trap (State And Local Taxes not deductible for AMT)
18. ✅ **Divorced Parent Dependency** → CORRECT: "Whoever has legal rights can claim dependent. Even though dad provides more support, without written documents, mom can claim"
    - Perfect understanding of custodial parent default rule
    - Knows Form 8332 required to change default
19. ✅ **OID Zero-Coupon Bond Taxation** → CORRECT: Compound interest accretion (not straight-line)
    - Requested example to remember
    - Understood phantom income concept
    - Knows taxable amount increases each year (compounding)
20. ✅ **Section 1231 Recapture Rules** → EXCELLENT: Student knew the HARD part!
    - **Buildings (§1250)**: Depreciation recapture at 25% ✓
    - **Equipment (§1245)**: Depreciation recapture at ordinary income rate ✓
    - Understood warehouse example: $100K recapture at 25%, remaining gain at 15-20% LTCG
    - "Exception to the exception" concept understood
21. ⏸️ **Depreciation vs Amortization** → Not yet answered (student requested save)

### Key Learning Points from Round 2:

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Excellent grasp of complex recapture rules (§1231, §1250, §1245)
- ✅ Strong understanding of divorce/dependency IRC §152(e)
- ✅ Correctly distinguishes penalty waivers vs access rights (hardship)
- ✅ Solid understanding of AMT add-backs after correction

**Critical Fix Needed**:
- ⚠️ **KIDDIE TAX NUMBERS**: Student said **$13,000** - actual is **$1,300**!!!
  - This is a 10x error that WILL cost points on exam
  - **MUST MEMORIZE**: $1,300 free, $1,300 at child rate, over $2,600 at parent rate
  - **NOT $13,000** - that would be way too generous!

**Score**: 6/7 correct (86%) - but the kiddie tax error is CRITICAL for exam

**Next**: Continue with more issues from tracker

## Estate Planning Topics Started (G.56, G.61)

**Progress**: 67/73 topics (92%)

### G.56 Estate Planning Documents ✅

**4 Essential Documents Mastered**:

**1. Will**:
- Distributes probate assets at death
- Names executor, guardian for minors
- Does NOT control: Life insurance, retirement accounts, joint property, POD/TOD
- Must go through probate (public record)

**2. Financial Power of Attorney**:
- General POA: Terminates at incapacity
- **Durable POA**: Survives incapacity ⭐ (most important!)
- Springing POA: Activates upon specific event
- **Ends at death** (does not control assets after death - that's the will)

**3. Healthcare Power of Attorney (Healthcare Proxy)**:
- Authorizes agent for medical decisions
- Separate from financial POA
- Includes HIPAA authorization
- Agent makes treatment decisions when you can't communicate

**4. Living Will (Advance Healthcare Directive)**:
- YOUR end-of-life treatment wishes
- Life support, resuscitation (DNR), artificial nutrition
- Different from Healthcare POA (instructions vs agent's decisions)
- Best practice: Have BOTH

**Key Distinctions Mastered**:
- POA = Alive (incapacity), Will = When dead
- Durable = Doesn't die with incapacity, General = Terminates
- Living Will = Your instructions, Healthcare POA = Agent decides
- Will controls probate assets only (not beneficiary designations)

**Practice Question**: Student correctly identified Durable POA for financial decisions during incapacity

### G.61 Business Transfer Techniques (In Progress)

**Buy-Sell Agreements**:

**Cross-Purchase Agreement**:
- Owners buy from each other
- Policies needed: n × (n - 1) [3 owners = 6 policies]
- Buyers get **basis step-up** ✅
- Premiums NOT deductible, death benefit tax-free
- Best for: 2-3 owners

**Entity-Purchase Agreement**:
- Company buys shares
- Policies needed: n [3 owners = 3 policies]
- NO basis step-up for surviving owners ❌
- May trigger AMT
- Best for: 4+ owners

**Wait-and-See (Hybrid)**:
- Combination approach
- Flexibility to choose best option at time of event

**Comparison Table Taught**:
- Cross-Purchase: More policies, basis step-up
- Entity-Purchase: Fewer policies, no basis step-up
- Memory: "Cross-Purchase = Complicated (many policies), Cost basis goes up"

**Valuation Methods**:
1. Fixed price (becomes outdated)
2. Formula-based (automatic adjustment)
3. Independent appraisal (most accurate)

**Family Business Transfer Techniques**:
1. Gifting with minority discounts (20-40%)
2. Installment sale to family
