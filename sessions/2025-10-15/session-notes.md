## Questions Asked

### Topic: Auto Insurance - Personal Auto Policy (PAP)

**Student's Request**: "I would like to know more about the car insurance. It's a bit confusing to me."

**Initial Understanding**:
- Had not studied car insurance yet
- Found it confusing as a topic
- Wanted to learn the fundamentals

**Explanation Given**:

**Personal Auto Policy Structure:**

**Part A - Liability Coverage:**
- Split limits format: 100/300/50
  - First number: Max per person for bodily injury
  - Second number: Max per accident for all injuries
  - Third number: Max for property damage
- Alternative: Combined single limit
- NO deductible, but policyholder liable for amounts over limits
- CFP point: High liability limits or umbrella policy recommended

**Part B - Medical Payments (Med Pay):**
- Pays medical expenses for insured and passengers
- Regardless of fault
- Typically $5k-$10k
- No deductible
- Coordinates with health insurance (no double payment)

**Part C - Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM):**
- Protects when other driver lacks adequate insurance
- Covers bodily injury and sometimes property damage
- Important: ~13% of drivers are uninsured

**Part D - Physical Damage:**
- **Collision**: Damage when you hit something (car, tree, pole)
  - Deductible applies (typically $500-$1,000)
  - Pays up to actual cash value (ACV)
- **Comprehensive**: Everything else (theft, vandalism, fire, hail, animal)
  - Deductible applies (often lower, like $250)
  - Also limited to ACV
- CFP tip: Consider dropping collision/comp on older low-value vehicles

**Who's Covered:**
- Named insured
- Family members living with insured
- Anyone using car with permission
- Insured driving someone else's car (with permission)
- **Trap**: No permission = no coverage

**Key Exclusions:**
- Business use (need commercial coverage)
- Intentional damage
- Using vehicle as residence
- Vehicles with fewer than 4 wheels

**Rental Car Coverage:**
- Liability follows you to rental cars (in US)
- Physical damage coverage depends on policy
- Often can decline rental company coverage

**Other Coverages:**
- Towing & Labor: ~$25-$100 per incident
- Rental Reimbursement: $30-$50/day while car repaired

**Comprehension Checks:**

1. **Split limits calculation**: 100/300/50 policy, accident with 4 injured people ($80k, $75k, $60k, $40k)
   - Student's answer: Total $255k, under $300k per-accident limit, each under $100k per-person limit → Insurance pays all $255k, zero personal liability ✓ PERFECT
   - Demonstrated excellent understanding of split limits

2. **Collision vs Comprehensive**:
   - Student's answer: "Collision if I hit something like another car. Comprehensive covers everything else - theft, car is gone for whatever reason" ✓ EXCELLENT
   - Clear understanding of the distinction

3. **Family member coverage**: Son (18, lives with you, listed on policy) borrows car, causes accident
   - Student's answer: Yes, covered ✓ CORRECT
   - Understood but didn't elaborate on reasoning

4. **Rental car liability**: Business trip, rent car, cause accident, have 250/500/100 personal policy
   - Student's answer: Yes, covered ✓ CORRECT
   - Understood but didn't elaborate on reasoning

**Understanding Level**: VERY GOOD - Grasped all major PAP components quickly:
- Understands split limits and calculation
- Clear on collision vs comprehensive distinction
- Knows who's covered under policy
- Understands rental car coverage basics
- Ready to move to next topic

**Key Learning**: Personal Auto Policy has 6 parts (A-D plus towing/rental), each serving different purposes. Liability has no deductible but exposes policyholder to personal liability above limits.

### Topic 2: Medicare Insurance

**Student's Request**: "Let's talk about the whole Medicare insurance thing. Help me to understand the whole Medicare insurance Like 65 All those things"

**Initial Understanding**:
- ✓ Knew there are 4 parts (A, B, C, D)
- ✓ Part A = hospital coverage
- ✓ Skilled nursing is part of Medicare
- ✓ Long-term care is NOT covered (excellent retention!)
- ✓ Knew about 90-day hospital concept
- ✓ Understood Medicare Advantage has network restrictions and can have $0 premium
- ✗ Had Parts C and D backwards (thought C = drugs, D = Advantage)
- ✓ Knew MAPD term (Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug)
- Partial knowledge on cost-sharing details

**Explanation Given**:

**Part A - Hospital Insurance:**
- Covers: Hospital stays, skilled nursing (after 3-day hospital stay), hospice, home health
- Hospital benefit periods:
  - Days 1-60: Deductible ($1,632 for 2024), Medicare pays rest
  - Days 61-90: Coinsurance (~$408/day)
  - Days 91-150: Lifetime reserve days (60 days total for entire life; ~$816/day)
  - After 150: Patient pays all
- Skilled nursing (after 3-day hospital stay):
  - Days 1-20: $0 cost
  - Days 21-100: Coinsurance (~$204/day)
  - After 100: Patient pays all
- Cost: FREE if worked 40+ quarters; otherwise ~$505/month

**Part B - Medical Insurance:**
- Covers: Doctor visits, preventive care, labs, X-rays, outpatient surgery, durable medical equipment, ambulance
- Standard premium: $174.70/month (2024)
- Deductible: $240/year
- Coinsurance: 20% of Medicare-approved amount
- **IRMAA**: Income-related adjustment can add $70-$400+ to premium (based on tax return from 2 years ago)

**Part C - Medicare Advantage:**
- Private insurance replacing Parts A + B (often includes D)
- Network restrictions (HMO/PPO)
- Pros: Often $0 premium, extra benefits (dental/vision/hearing), out-of-pocket max
- Cons: Network limits, may need referrals, copays per service

**Part D - Prescription Drugs:**
- Standalone drug coverage for Original Medicare
- Sold by private companies
- Premium varies ($7-$200+/month)
- Late enrollment penalty: 1% per month delayed (for life)

**Enrollment and Penalties:**
- **Initial Enrollment Period (IEP)**: 7-month window (3 months before + birthday month + 3 months after turning 65)
- **Part B penalty**: 10% for EACH 12-month period delayed (for life)
- **Part D penalty**: 1% per month delayed (for life)
- **Exception**: Creditable coverage through employer (20+ employees) allows delay without penalty

**Comprehension Checks:**

1. **Enrollment question**: Age 65 in June, still working, employer has 100 employees, has group health insurance - should they enroll in Parts A and B?
   - Student's answer: "They can wait because they have company sponsored insurance" ✓ PARTIALLY CORRECT
   - Understood Part B can be delayed with employer coverage
   - Didn't address Part A separately (which is free and can be enrolled without triggering Part B enrollment)

2. **Cost calculation**: Hospitalized 75 days, deductible already paid - what's the cost?
   - Student's answer: "Pay coinsurance $408 per day" ✓ CORRECT NUMBER
   - Identified correct coinsurance rate for days 61-90
   - Didn't calculate total amount (days 61-75 = 15 days × $408 = $6,120)
   - Shows understanding of concept but needs more practice on calculations

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Strong conceptual foundation:
- Already knew basic structure of Medicare parts
- Quickly corrected C/D confusion
- Understands enrollment penalty exceptions
- Grasps cost-sharing concepts
- Needs more practice on specific calculations and number details

**Key Learning**: Medicare has Original (A+B+D) vs Advantage (C), age 65 enrollment critical, lifetime penalties for late enrollment without creditable coverage, Part A has benefit periods and lifetime reserve days.

## Notes

Session 3 - Student is 22 days from exam. Two topics covered today: auto insurance (mastered quickly) and Medicare (good conceptual foundation, corrected C/D confusion, retained knowledge about long-term care not being covered). Student showed excellent retention of previous concepts and made connections between topics. Preferred to keep moving through material rather than deep practice. Ready to continue Medicare deeper or move to other high-priority topics in next session.
