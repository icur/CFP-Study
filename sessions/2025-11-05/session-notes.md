## Topics Covered Today

### Topic 1: B.15 Education Funding (General Principles Domain)

**Initial Understanding**:
- Student remembered: "Subsidized = government puts money for you, more like a grant"
- Student thought: "Subsidized is not really a loan, unsubsidized is literally a loan"
- Student recalled: "Stafford = money given to you, PLUS = parent's something"
- **Key misconception**: Thought subsidized loans were like grants (free money)

**Explanation Given**:

#### **KEY CORRECTION: Subsidized ≠ Grant**

**The Truth**: Subsidized loans are **STILL LOANS** - must repay principal!

**The Difference is WHO PAYS INTEREST**:

| Loan Type | Must Repay? | Who Pays Interest While in School? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Subsidized** | YES (it's a loan!) | Government pays (no interest accrues) ✅ |
| **Unsubsidized** | YES (it's a loan!) | Student pays (interest accrues from day 1) ❌ |

**Example** (Student borrows $10K, in school 4 years, 5% interest):
- Subsidized: Owe $10,000 after graduation (government paid interest)
- Unsubsidized: Owe $12,155 after graduation (interest accrued ~$2,155)

#### **Federal Student Loan Types**:

**1. Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans** (Best deal!)
- Who: Undergraduate students with financial need
- Government pays interest while in school, grace period, deferment
- Lower interest rates (~4-5%)
- Annual limits: $3,500-$5,500/year (by year in school)
- Must demonstrate financial need (FAFSA)

**2. Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans**
- Who: Any student (undergrad or grad), no financial need required
- Interest accrues immediately
- Higher annual limits than subsidized
- Undergrad dependent: $5,500-$7,500/year
- Undergrad independent: Up to $12,500/year
- Grad students: Up to $20,500/year

**3. Parent PLUS Loans** (Student remembered this!)
- Who: Parents of dependent undergraduate students
- Can borrow up to full cost of attendance (minus other aid)
- Higher interest rate (~7-8%)
- Credit check required
- Parents responsible for repayment (not student)
- No annual or aggregate limits (just COA)

**4. Grad PLUS Loans**
- Same as Parent PLUS but for grad students borrowing for themselves
- Up to full cost of attendance
- Credit check required

#### **Borrowing Hierarchy** (Best to Worst):

```
1. FREE MONEY FIRST
   ├─ Pell Grants (up to $7,395/year for low income)
   ├─ Other grants/scholarships
   └─ Work-Study programs

2. CHEAP LOANS NEXT
   ├─ Direct Subsidized Stafford (government pays interest) ⭐
   └─ Direct Unsubsidized Stafford (lower rates)

3. EXPENSIVE LOANS LAST
   ├─ Parent PLUS (higher rates ~7-8%)
   └─ Private loans (highest rates) ❌

4. NEVER BORROW FROM
   └─ Retirement accounts ❌❌
```

#### **Annual Borrowing Limits** (Dependent Undergraduates):

| Year | Subsidized Max | Total Max (Sub + Unsub) |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| Freshman | $3,500 | $5,500 |
| Sophomore | $4,500 | $6,500 |
| Junior/Senior | $5,500 | $7,500 |

**Aggregate limit**: $31,000 total undergrad (max $23,000 subsidized)

#### **Loan Repayment Options**:

**Standard Repayment**: 10 years, fixed payment (pays off fastest, least interest)

**Graduated Repayment**: 10 years, payments start low and increase every 2 years

**Extended Repayment**: Up to 25 years (lower monthly, MORE total interest)

**Income-Driven Repayment Plans**:

| Plan | Payment | Forgiveness After |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **IBR** (Income-Based) | 10-15% of discretionary income | 20-25 years |
| **PAYE** (Pay As You Earn) | 10% of discretionary income | 20 years |
| **REPAYE** (Revised PAYE) | 10% of discretionary income | 20-25 years |
| **ICR** (Income-Contingent) | 20% of discretionary income | 25 years |

**Key**: Payment based on income (not loan balance). After 20-25 years, remaining balance forgiven (but TAXABLE!)

#### **Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)**:

**Requirements**:
- Work for government or 501(c)(3) nonprofit
- Make 120 qualifying payments (10 years)
- Must be on income-driven repayment plan
- Forgiveness is **TAX-FREE** ✅ (unlike other IDR forgiveness)

**Example**: Teacher borrows $100K, pays $300/month for 10 years, $64K remaining → FORGIVEN TAX-FREE!

#### **Work-Study Programs**:

- Part-time jobs for students with financial need
- Often on-campus
- Typically $2,000-$4,000/year
- Money earned does NOT count against financial aid (huge benefit!)

#### **Grants** (Free Money!):

**Pell Grant**:
- Up to $7,395/year (2024-25)
- Based on financial need
- Undergraduate only
- No repayment required ✅

**FSEOG**: $100-$4,000/year for extremely low-income students

**TEACH Grant**: Up to $4,000/year (TRAP: converts to UNSUBSIDIZED LOAN if don't fulfill teaching requirement!)

#### **Memory Systems Created**:

**"SUBsidized = government SUBstitutes for interest payments"**

**"UNsubsidized = UNlucky, you pay all interest"**

**"PLUS = Parents' Loan, Unfortunately Spendy"**
- Parents borrow
- Loan (not grant)
- Unfortunately high rates
- Spendy (most expensive federal option)

**"Stafford Starts at $3,500, Steps up $1,000"**
- Freshman: $3,500 subsidized
- Sophomore: $4,500 (+$1K)
- Junior/Senior: $5,500 (+$1K)

**"PSLF = Public Service, Loans Forgiven (Free!)"**
- 10 years (120 payments)
- Public service job required
- Tax-free forgiveness

**"Free → Subsidized → Unsubsidized → PLUS → Please don't use Private!"**

**Key Learning**:
- Subsidized loans are STILL LOANS (not grants!) - must repay principal
- Difference: Government pays interest while in school (subsidized) vs student pays (unsubsidized)
- PLUS loans = Parents borrow, higher rates, no limits
- Borrowing hierarchy: Always exhaust free money and subsidized loans first
- PSLF = Best deal for public service workers (tax-free forgiveness after 10 years)

**Status**: **MASTERED** ✅ (Student now understands subsidized ≠ grant, it's still a loan!)

### Topic 2: F.48 Money Purchase Pension Plans (Retirement Planning Domain)

**Question**: "Which statements about money purchase pension plans are CORRECT?" (4 statements)

**Student's Answer**: A (all 4 correct) - **INCORRECT** ❌

**Correct Answer**: D (1, 2, and 3 only) - Statement 4 is FALSE

**Initial Understanding**:
- Student said: "no idea what's 410b explain the whole thing to me"
- Student also mentioned: "I don't really know about money purchase pension plan so tell me more"
- Needed complete explanation from scratch

**Explanation Given**:

#### **What is Money Purchase Pension Plan?**

**Definition**: Defined Contribution plan with **MANDATORY** employer contributions

**Key Concept**: Employer MUST contribute a **FIXED PERCENTAGE** of compensation every year (no exceptions!)

**Example**:
- Company adopts 10% Money Purchase plan
- Employee salary: $100,000
- Employer MUST contribute $10,000 EVERY YEAR (profit or loss!)

**Why "Money Purchase"**: You're "purchasing" retirement money with mandatory contributions

#### **Money Purchase vs Other Plans**:

| Feature | Money Purchase | Profit-Sharing | 401(k) | Defined Benefit |
|---------|----------------|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Who contributes?** | Employer only | Employer only | Employee + match | Employer only |
| **Flexibility** | ❌ MANDATORY % | ✅ Discretionary | ✅ Employee choice | ❌ Actuarial |
| **Predictable cost?** | ✅ YES (% × payroll) | ❌ Varies | ❌ Varies | ❌ Actuarial |
| **Easy to understand?** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ❌ Complex |
| **Investment risk** | Employee | Employee | Employee | Employer |
| **Annual limit** | $69K or 100% | $69K or 100% | $69K total | Actuarial |

#### **Statement Analysis**:

**Statement 1: "Plan sponsor's costs are predictable, and plan is easily administered"** ✅ TRUE
- Fixed % × total payroll = exact annual cost
- Simple calculation (no actuarial work)
- Unlike profit-sharing (varies) or DB plan (actuarial changes)

**Statement 2: "Participant can easily understand, contributions based on salary each year"** ✅ TRUE
- "You make $50K, we put in 10% = $5,000. Done." ✅
- Much simpler than DB pension
- Based on CURRENT salary (not final salary like DB)
- Each year counts independently (DC feature)

**Statement 3: "Annual additions limited to lesser of 100% or $69,000 (2024)"** ✅ TRUE
- IRC §415(c) Defined Contribution limit
- Annual additions = employer contributions + employee deferrals + forfeitures
- Lesser of 100% of compensation OR $69,000

**Examples**:
- $50K salary, 10% plan → $5,000 contribution (under limits)
- $300K salary, 10% plan → $30,000 contribution (under limits)
- $800K salary, 10% plan → Would be $80K but CAPPED at $69,000

**Statement 4: "Employer securities cannot exceed 25% of FMV"** ❌ FALSE

**THE CORRECT RULE: Cannot exceed 10% (not 25%!)**

**Why this limit exists**:
- Prevents overconcentration in company stock
- Diversification protection (Enron lessons)
- Employees already depend on company for job

**The 10% Rule** (IRC §407):
- Money Purchase plan can hold UP TO 10% in employer securities
- Measured at time of purchase
- Example: $1M plan assets → Can buy up to $100K company stock

**Where does 25% come from?** (The trap!)
- 401(k) plans: Can hold MORE employer stock (no 10% limit)
- Profit-sharing: Can hold MORE employer stock
- Stock Bonus Plans/ESOPs: Can hold 100%!
- BUT Money Purchase: Limited to 10% only

**Employer Securities Limits Table**:

| Plan Type | Employer Stock Limit | Why? |
|-----------|---------------------|------|
| **Money Purchase Pension** | **10% max** ⭐ | Pension = need diversification |
| 401(k) | No limit | Employee choice |
| Profit-Sharing | No specific limit | Flexible design |
| ESOP | 100% allowed | Designed for stock! |

#### **Memory Systems Created**:

**"Money Purchase = 4 P's"**
1. **P**redictable costs (fixed % each year) ✓
2. **P**articipants understand easily ✓
3. **P**lan limit $69K or 100% ✓
4. **P**rotected from employer stock (10% max, NOT 25%!) ✓

**"Money Purchase = Math is Predictable"** (simple multiplication)

**"Money Purchase = 10% MAX (More Protected)"**

**"Pension Plans = 10% Protection, Everything else = More flexible"**

#### **Why Money Purchase Plans Are Rare Today**:
- Too rigid! Must contribute even in bad years
- Most converted to Profit-Sharing plans (more flexible)
- Can combine with Profit-Sharing (have both)
- Mostly replaced by Safe Harbor 401(k)

**Key Learning**:
- Money Purchase = MANDATORY employer contribution (fixed %)
- Predictable costs, easy to understand
- Annual limit: $69K or 100% of compensation
- **Employer securities limit: 10% (not 25%)** - this is the exam trap!
- Different from profit-sharing (discretionary) and DB (benefit promise)

**Status**: **MASTERED** ✅

### Topic 3: F.48 Section 410(b) Coverage Rules (Retirement Planning Domain)

**Question**: "Which statements about Section 410(b) coverage rule are CORRECT?" (2 statements)

**Student's Answer**: C (II only) - **INCORRECT** ❌

**Correct Answer**: D (I only)

**Initial Understanding**:
- Student said: "no idea what's 410b explain the whole thing to me"
- Also mentioned knowing about: "top heavy rule, HCE vs NHCE, average benefit and coverage rule"
- Needed comprehensive explanation of coverage testing

**Explanation Given**:

#### **Why Section 410(b) Exists**:

**Problem Congress Prevented**:
- Rich owner: "I'll create 401(k)... but only I can use it!"
- Gets huge tax deduction
- Employees get nothing
- IRS: "Nope! Must cover REAL employees too!"

**Section 410(b) = COVERAGE Rule**: Plan must cover reasonable portion of workforce

#### **HCE vs NHCE** (Foundation):

**HCE (Highly Compensated Employee)**:
1. Owns >5% of company (any time current or prior year), OR
2. Earned >$150,000 in prior year (2024 threshold)

**NHCE (Non-Highly Compensated Employee)**: Everyone else

**Examples**:
- CEO making $500K → HCE ✓
- Owner's spouse (3% owner, $80K) → HCE ✓ (>5% owner)
- Manager $140K → NHCE ✓ (under $150K)
- Janitor $35K → NHCE ✓

#### **The Big Picture: Anti-Discrimination Rules**:

| Rule | Section | What It Tests | Apply To |
|------|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Coverage** | **§410(b)** | Does plan cover enough employees? | ALL plans |
| Nondiscrimination | §401(a)(4) | Benefits/contributions fair? | ALL plans |
| ADP Test | §401(k)(3) | Employee deferrals | 401(k) only |
| ACP Test | §401(m) | Employer match | 401(k) only |
| Top-Heavy | §416 | Key employees >60%? | ALL plans |

**Focus**: §410(b) COVERAGE (does plan cover enough people?)

#### **The 3 Coverage Tests** (Must pass ONE of THREE):

**TEST #1: PERCENTAGE TEST** (Safe Harbor - Easiest!)

**Rule**: Plan covers **≥70%** of all NHCEs

**Formula**: Covered NHCEs ÷ Total NHCEs ≥ 70%

**Example**:
- 100 employees: 10 HCEs, 90 NHCEs
- Plan covers: 10 HCEs, 65 NHCEs
- Test: 65 ÷ 90 = 72.2% > 70% → PASSES! ✅

**TEST #2: RATIO TEST** (Ratio of Coverage Rates)

**Rule**: (NHCE coverage rate ÷ HCE coverage rate) ≥ 70%

**Steps**:
1. NHCE coverage rate: Covered NHCEs ÷ Total NHCEs
2. HCE coverage rate: Covered HCEs ÷ Total HCEs
3. Divide: NHCE rate ÷ HCE rate
4. Must be ≥ 70%

**Example**:
- 10 HCEs, 90 NHCEs
- Plan covers: 8 HCEs, 50 NHCEs
- HCE rate: 8 ÷ 10 = 80%
- NHCE rate: 50 ÷ 90 = 55.6%
- Ratio: 55.6% ÷ 80% = 69.4% < 70% → FAILS! ❌

**Fix**: Cover 56 NHCEs → 62.2% ÷ 80% = 77.8% → PASSES! ✅

**TEST #3: AVERAGE BENEFIT PERCENTAGE TEST** ⭐ (The Trap!)

**THE CORRECT NAME**: "Average **BENEFIT** Percentage Test"

**NOT**: "Average **CONTRIBUTION** Percentage Test" ❌

**Two-Part Test**:
- Part A: Nondiscriminatory classification (reasonable business criteria)
- Part B: Average benefit % - (NHCE avg ÷ HCE avg) ≥ 70%

**Why This Is Confusing**:

| Test Name | Abbreviation | What It Tests | Code Section |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Actual Deferral % | ADP | Employee 401(k) deferrals | §401(k)(3) |
| **Actual Contribution %** | **ACP** | Employer match + after-tax | **§401(m)** |
| **Average Benefit %** | **ABP** | Overall benefits/contributions | **§410(b)** ⭐ |

**The Exam Trap**: Swap "contribution" for "benefit" to confuse students!

#### **Statement Analysis**:

**Statement I: "Plan can cover any portion of workforce, as long as satisfies 1 of 3 tests"** ✅ TRUE
- Don't need to cover everyone ✓
- Don't need to pass all 3 tests ✓
- Just need ONE of the 3 tests ✓
- Flexibility in plan design ✓

**Statement II: "Tests are percentage, ratio, or average contribution percentage"** ❌ FALSE
- First two correct: Percentage ✓, Ratio ✓
- Third WRONG: Should be "Average **BENEFIT** Percentage" (not contribution!)
- ACP = Different test (§401m for matching contributions)
- ABP = Coverage test (§410b)

**Answer: D (I only)** - Statement II has wrong test name!

#### **Memory Systems Created**:

**"410(b) = 3 P's to Pass"**
1. **P**ercentage test (70% of NHCEs)
2. **P**roportion test (Ratio = 70%)
3. **P**roportional benefits (Average **Benefit** % = 70%)

**"Coverage Tests vs Other Tests"**
- §410(b) = Coverage (enough people?)
- §401(k)(3) = ADP (employee deferrals)
- §401(m) = ACP (employer match)
- §416 = Top-heavy (>60% to key employees)

**"Benefit vs Contribution"**
- Average **B**enefit % = **B** for 410(**B**) coverage ✓
- Average **C**ontribution % = **C** for 401(m) mat**C**h ✓

**"70% = Safe Harbor Shore"** (you've reached safety with percentage test)

#### **Connection to Top-Heavy** (Student mentioned this):

**Top-Heavy Rule (§416)** = Different test!
- Plan where >60% of benefits go to key employees
- Must provide minimum 3% contribution to NHCEs
- Faster vesting required

**Connection**:
- §410(b) = Must cover enough people (quantity)
- §416 = Benefits can't be too concentrated at top (distribution)
- Both prevent discrimination, different angles!

**Key Learning**:
- §410(b) = Coverage rule (must cover enough employees)
- 3 tests: Percentage (70% NHCEs), Ratio (70% ratio), Average **BENEFIT** % (not contribution!)
- Only need to pass ONE of the 3 tests
- Exam trap: "Average Contribution %" is WRONG - it's "Average BENEFIT %"
- Don't confuse: ACP (§401m match) vs ABP (§410b coverage)

**Status**: **MASTERED** ✅

### Topic 4: F.48 Safe Harbor 401(k) Rules (Retirement Planning Domain)

**Question**: "Which statements about safe harbor 401(k) rules are CORRECT?" (4 statements)

**Student's Answer**: D (4 only) - **INCORRECT** ❌

**Correct Answer**: B (All 4 correct - 1, 2, 3, and 4)

**Initial Understanding**:
- Student surprised: "all correct really?"
- Thought only the notice requirement (Statement 4) was correct
- Didn't realize Statements 1 & 2 describe TWO DIFFERENT safe harbor options

**Explanation Given**:

#### **The Problem: ADP/ACP Testing is a Nightmare**

**ADP Test**: Tests employee 401(k) deferrals (HCEs vs NHCEs)
**ACP Test**: Tests employer matching contributions

**Problems**:
- Complex annual calculation
- Done AFTER year ends (too late!)
- If FAIL → Must return money to HCEs (they're MAD!)
- Owner/executives can't max out 401(k)

#### **The Solution: Safe Harbor 401(k)**

**Congress Said**: "If generous enough, SKIP testing entirely!"

**Safe Harbor = Skip ADP/ACP testing if**:
1. Give generous benefit (match OR nonelective)
2. 100% vested immediately
3. Give advance notice

**Think**: "Pay 'generosity tax' upfront, get freedom from testing"

#### **The Two Safe Harbor Formulas** (Pick ONE):

**OPTION 1: Safe Harbor MATCH**

Two matching formula choices:

**Formula A: Traditional**
- Match 100% of first 3% of compensation
- PLUS 50% of next 2%
- Total: Up to 4% match if employee defers 5%

**Example** ($100K salary):
- Employee defers 5%: $5,000
- Employer match: 100% × 3% = $3,000
- Plus 50% × 2% = $1,000
- Total match: $4,000 (4% of salary)

**Formula B: Enhanced** ⭐ (Statement 1!)
- Match **100% up to 4%** of compensation
- Simpler, more generous

**Example** ($100K salary):
- Employee defers 4%: $4,000
- Employer match: 100% × 4% = $4,000

**Statement 1 says**: "100% up to 4%" → Enhanced formula ✅ CORRECT!

**OPTION 2: Safe Harbor NONELECTIVE** (Statement 2!)

**Rule**: Contribute **3% of compensation** to ALL eligible employees

**Key**: Employees don't need to defer ANYTHING - they get 3% whether participate or not!

**Example**:
- Employee A: $50K, defers 0% → Gets $1,500 (3%)
- Employee B: $80K, defers 10% → Gets $2,400 (3%)
- Employee C: $120K, defers 0% → Gets $3,600 (3%)

**Statement 2 says**: "3% or more for all eligible, whether or not participate" ✅ CORRECT!

#### **Requirement: 100% Immediate Vesting** (Statement 3!)

**Rule**: Safe Harbor contributions MUST be 100% vested IMMEDIATELY

**What this means**:
- Employee owns money from day 1
- Can't have vesting schedule
- If quit tomorrow, keep 100% of safe harbor money

**Why**: Trade-off for skipping testing - employees get full ownership

**Can you have vesting on OTHER contributions?**
- Safe harbor: MUST be 100% immediate ✅
- Profit-sharing: CAN have vesting schedule ✅
- Discretionary match: CAN have vesting ✅

**Example**:
- Safe harbor match (4%): 100% vested
- Profit-sharing (5%): 3-year cliff OK
- Employee works 2 years, quits:
  - Keeps 100% safe harbor ✅
  - Forfeits profit-sharing ❌

**Statement 3 says**: "Must be immediately 100% vested" ✅ CORRECT!

#### **Requirement: Annual Notice** (Statement 4!)

**Rule**: Must provide written notice to all eligible employees

**When**: At least **30 days before** plan year begins (or before eligible)

**What notice must say**:
- Explanation of safe harbor contributions
- Matching formula OR nonelective amount
- Vesting (100% immediate)
- Employee rights and obligations
- How to make/change deferrals

**Example timeline**:
- Plan year: Jan 1 - Dec 31
- Notice deadline: December 1 of prior year (30+ days before)

**Statement 4 says**: "Must provide notice about rights and obligations" ✅ CORRECT!

#### **Safe Harbor Summary Table**:

| Feature | Safe Harbor Match | Safe Harbor Nonelective |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Formula** | 100% up to 4% (enhanced) | 3% to ALL |
| **Employee defer?** | YES (to get match) | NO (get anyway!) |
| **Who gets it?** | Deferrers only | ALL eligible |
| **Vesting** | 100% immediate | 100% immediate |
| **Notice** | YES (30 days) | YES (30 days) |
| **Skip testing?** | YES ✅ | YES ✅ |
| **Cheaper?** | Usually (only pay deferrers) | More expensive (pay everyone) |

#### **Why All 4 Statements Correct**:

**Statement 1**: ✅ Enhanced match formula (100% up to 4%)
**Statement 2**: ✅ Nonelective formula (3% to all)
**Statement 3**: ✅ 100% immediate vesting required
**Statement 4**: ✅ 30-day notice required

**Answer: B (All 4 correct)**

#### **Why Student Selected D (4 only)**:

**Student thought**:
- "Statements 1 & 2 can't both be right - different formulas!"
- "Maybe only notice (4) is correct?"

**Truth**: Statements 1 & 2 describe **TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS**
- Statement 1 = Match option
- Statement 2 = Nonelective option
- BOTH are valid ways to achieve safe harbor!
- Pick ONE, but both statements factually correct

**Exam trap**: Testing if you know MULTIPLE safe harbor formulas exist!

#### **Memory Systems Created**:

**"Safe Harbor = 3-4-100-30"**
- **3%** nonelective OR **4%** enhanced match
- **100%** vested immediately
- **30** days notice

**"Safe Harbor = Skip Testing, But Pay the Price"**
- Skip: ADP/ACP testing ✅
- Pay: Generous contributions (3-4%)
- Price: 100% vesting + notice

**"Match vs Nonelective"**
- **M**atch = Must defer to get it
- **N**onelective = **N**o deferrals needed

#### **Additional Rules**:

**Can reduce mid-year?**
- Generally NO (must commit full year)
- Exception: Financial hardship
- Must give 30-day notice

**Can have BOTH safe harbor AND profit-sharing?**
- YES! Very common
- Safe harbor: Avoids testing, 100% vested
- Profit-sharing: Additional, can have vesting

**What if super generous (6% match)?**
- Safe harbor portion (4%): 100% vested
- Additional (2%): Can have vesting schedule

**Key Learning**:
- Safe Harbor = Skip ADP/ACP testing (huge benefit!)
- Two formulas: Match (4% enhanced) OR Nonelective (3%)
- Requirements: 100% immediate vesting + 30-day notice
- All 4 statements correct (1 & 2 aren't contradictory - two different options!)
- Statements 1 & 2 both factually true because they're different safe harbor choices

**Status**: **MASTERED** ✅

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

| Topic | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **B.15 Student Loan Types** | Medium | Initially thought subsidized loans were "like grants" (free money). Now understands: BOTH are loans, difference is WHO pays interest while in school (government vs student) |
| **F.48 Money Purchase Pension Plans** | Medium | Had no prior knowledge. Now understands: DC plan with MANDATORY employer contribution (fixed %), predictable costs, employer securities limited to 10% (not 25%) |
| **F.48 Section 410(b) Coverage** | Medium | Didn't know the 3 tests or what §410(b) was. Now understands: Must pass 1 of 3 tests (Percentage, Ratio, Average BENEFIT %). Confused "Average Contribution %" (ACP) with "Average Benefit %" (ABP) |
| **F.48 Safe Harbor 401(k)** | Low | Thought only notice requirement correct, didn't realize Statements 1 & 2 describe different options. Now understands: TWO safe harbor formulas (match OR nonelective), both require 100% vesting + 30-day notice |

---
