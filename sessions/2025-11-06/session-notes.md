## Topics Covered

### Topic 1: F.49 SEP Plan Rules (Retirement Planning Domain)

**Question**: Which statement about SEP plans is CORRECT?

**Student's Answer**: A (SEP can limit to full-time employees age 21+) - **INCORRECT** ❌

**Correct Answer**: D (SEP contributions not subject to FICA/FUTA)

**Initial Understanding**:
- Selected option about limiting to full-time employees
- Didn't know SEP coverage rules or FICA/FUTA treatment

**Explanation Given** (SHORT VERSION):

#### **Statement A: "Can limit to full-time employees 21+"** ❌ FALSE

**The Rule**: SEP must cover **PART-TIME employees** too!

**SEP Coverage Requirements**:
- Age 21+
- Worked 3 of last 5 years
- Earned $750+ (2024)
- **INCLUDES part-time!** (can't exclude)

**Memory**: "**S**EP includes **P**art-timers"

---

#### **Statement B: "Must be C corporation"** ❌ FALSE

**The Rule**: ANY entity can have SEP
- C corp ✅
- S corp ✅
- Partnership ✅
- Sole proprietor ✅

---

#### **Statement C: "SERP reduces SEP deduction"** ❌ FALSE

**The Rule**: SERP (nonqualified) doesn't affect SEP (qualified)
- Separate calculations
- No interaction

**Memory**: "**S**ERP doesn't **S**crew up **S**EP"

---

#### **Statement D: "SEP contributions not subject to FICA/FUTA"** ✅ TRUE

**The Rule**: SEP employer contributions = **NO payroll tax!**

**Why this matters**:
- Regular wages: Pay FICA (7.65%) + FUTA
- SEP contributions: NO FICA, NO FUTA 💰

**Example**:
- Salary: $50,000 → FICA applies
- SEP contribution: $12,500 → NO FICA! ✅

**Memory**: "**S**EP **S**aves payroll tax (**S**kips FICA/FUTA)"

---

**Summary Table**:

| Statement | True/False | Quick Rule |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| A - Full-time only | ❌ | Must cover part-time |
| B - C corp only | ❌ | Any entity works |
| C - SERP reduces SEP | ❌ | Nonqualified ≠ qualified |
| **D - No FICA/FUTA** | **✅** | **SEP skips payroll tax!** |

**Answer: D**

---

#### **Follow-Up: FICA/FUTA for All Retirement Plans**

**Student Asked**: "does other retirement plans subject to FICA and FUTA? or they all not"

**SIMPLE RULE**:
- **EMPLOYER contributions** = NO FICA/FUTA ✅
- **EMPLOYEE deferrals** = YES FICA/FUTA ❌

**Complete Table**:

| Plan Type | Contribution | FICA/FUTA? |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| SEP | Employer only | ❌ NO |
| 401(k) match | Employer | ❌ NO |
| 401(k) deferrals | Employee | ✅ YES! |
| Profit-Sharing | Employer | ❌ NO |
| Money Purchase | Employer | ❌ NO |
| SIMPLE IRA match | Employer | ❌ NO |
| SIMPLE IRA deferrals | Employee | ✅ YES! |

**Why**: Employee deferrals = WAGES when earned → FICA applies!

**401(k) Example** ($100K salary, defer $10K, get $5K match):
- Salary $100K: FICA on full $100K ✅
- Employee deferral $10K: Already in $100K → FICA paid ✅
- Employer match $5K: NO FICA/FUTA ❌

**Memory**:
- "**EMPLOYER** contributions = **E**xempt"
- "**EMPLOYEE** deferrals = **E**arned wages (FICA applies)"

**Key Learning**:
- SEP contributions skip FICA/FUTA (employer contributions exempt)
- Must cover part-time employees (can't exclude by hours)
- SERP (nonqualified) doesn't affect SEP deduction limits
- Employee deferrals always subject to FICA/FUTA at time earned

---

### Topic 2: F.47 DB vs DC Plans - Which Provides More Income? (Retirement Planning Domain)

**Question**: Which is characteristic of DB pension plans?

**Student's Answer**: D (DB provides LESS income than DC) - **INCORRECT** ❌

**Correct Answer**: B (DB provides MORE income than DC)

**Initial Understanding**:
- Student thought: "return is higher in DC plan but contribution max is smaller"
- Had it BACKWARDS!
- Confused DC $69K limit with total accumulation potential

**Explanation Given** (SHORT VERSION):

#### **THE TRUTH**: DB Plans = WAY BIGGER Contributions!

**DB plans**: Can contribute $300K-$500K/year (age 55+)
**DC plans**: Limited to $69K/year max

---

#### **Why DB Plans Provide MORE Income**:

**1. Past Service Funding** 🔑

**DB can fund RETROACTIVELY**:
- Owner age 55, never had plan
- Adopts DB: "I'll get $150K/year at 65"
- Can fund ALL 30 years of past service!
- Contributes $200K-$400K/year to catch up 💰

**DC**: Can ONLY contribute for current year ($69K)

---

**2. Age-Weighted = HUGE for Older Owners**

**DB Contribution Examples**:

| Age | DB Contribution | DC Limit | DB Advantage |
|-----|----------------|----------|--------------|
| 30 | $20K | $69K | DC wins |
| 45 | $120K | $69K | DB wins |
| **55** | **$350K** 🚀 | $69K | **DB wins BIG!** |
| **62** | **$500K+** 🚀 | $69K | **DB dominates!** |

**Why?** Less time to retirement = need MASSIVE contributions!

---

**3. The Math**:

**Goal**: $200K/year pension at 65

**Age 55 (10 years left)**:
- DB plan: $400K/year × 10 = **$4.0M** ✅
- DC plan: $69K/year × 10 = **$690K** ❌

**DB wins by $3.3M!** 🎯

---

#### **Why Statement B is Correct**:

**"DB plans provide MORE retirement income than DC plans"**

**Reasons**:
1. Can fund past service (DC can't)
2. NO $69K annual limit for older employees
3. Can contribute $300K-$500K/year (age 55+)
4. Designed to reach specific BENEFIT goal

---

#### **Why Student Had It Backwards**:

**Student thought**: "DC has higher returns, smaller contributions"

**Truth**:
- ✅ DC MAY have higher investment returns (employee chooses)
- ❌ BUT DB allows MUCH LARGER contributions ($500K vs $69K!)
- Result: DB accumulates more $ despite potentially lower returns

**Example**:
- DB: $400K/year @ 5% return = $5M
- DC: $69K/year @ 8% return = $1M
- **DB still wins!** (contribution size > return difference)

---

#### **Statement C - DB + DC Together**:

**"Can use DB + DC together"** = TRUE! ✅

**Example**:
- DB plan: $400K/year
- DC (profit-sharing): $69K/year
- **TOTAL: $469K/year!** 🚀

**But Statement C says**: "increase EMPLOYEE'S contributions"
- Wrong wording: Employee doesn't contribute to DB (employer does)
- Should say "increase EMPLOYER'S contributions"

---

**Memory Systems Created**:

**"DB = Dinosaur Benefits (HUGE for old people!)"**

**"DC = Defined Cap ($69K limit)"**

**"DB = Bigger Dollars (especially age 55+)"**

**"DB = Dump truckloads of money in (age 55+)"**

**"DC = Don't Count on huge contributions (capped)"**

---

**Summary Table**:

| Feature | DB Plan | DC Plan |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Annual contribution** | $300K-$500K+ (age 55+) | $69K max |
| **Past service** | Can fund retroactively ✅ | Current year only ❌ |
| **Age-weighted** | HUGE for older owners ✅ | Same limit all ages |
| **Who contributes** | Employer only | Employer + employee |
| **Best for** | Older high-income owners | Younger employees |
| **Typical income** | $150K-$250K/year | $50K-$100K/year |

**Key Learning**:
- DB plans provide MORE retirement income than DC (opposite of what student thought!)
- DB allows $300K-$500K/year contributions (age 55+) vs DC $69K limit
- Can fund past service = massive catch-up contributions
- DB better for older business owners, DC better for younger employees
- Can have BOTH DB + DC plans simultaneously

**Status**: **MASTERED** ✅ (Student now understands DB > DC for income!)

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

| Topic | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| F.49 SEP Coverage Rules | Low | Thought could exclude part-time employees. Now understands: Must cover part-time (3 of 5 years, age 21+, $750+) |
| F.49 SEP vs SERP Interaction | Low | Thought SERP reduced SEP limits. Now understands: Nonqualified (SERP) doesn't affect qualified (SEP) |
| F.49 FICA/FUTA Treatment | Medium | Didn't know employer contributions exempt. Now understands: Employer = NO FICA/FUTA, Employee deferrals = YES FICA/FUTA |
| F.47 DB vs DC Income Comparison | Medium-High | **Had it backwards!** Thought DC provided more income. Now understands: DB allows $300K-$500K/year (age 55+) vs DC $69K limit. DB can fund past service. DB provides MORE income for older owners |
